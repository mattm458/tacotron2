# Tacotron 2

This repository contains an implementation of Tacotron 2. It is heavily based on [Nvidia's implementation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2). It implements intuitively controllable utterance-level features as in [Raitio et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06775), and includes additional options for conditioning on target feature values that I am currently researching.
