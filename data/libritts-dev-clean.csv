dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000027_000004.wav|174|To meet was to find each other.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000030_000001.wav|174|There he seemed perfectly secure.

dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000036_000000.wav|174|It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, all cracked with chilblains, and kissed it.

dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000040_000000.wav|174|To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearly the whole of Jean Valjean's existence.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000016_000000.wav|174|Some new thing had come into his soul.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000037_000002.wav|174|She had emerged from misery, and she was entering into life.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000027_000001.wav|174|Destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences, differing in age, alike in sorrow.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000030_000000.wav|174|Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000043_000004.wav|174|He protected her, and she strengthened him.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000025_000000.wav|174|The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; she thought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000024_000004.wav|174|She had loved the dog, and he had died, after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000043_000005.wav|174|Thanks to him, she could walk through life; thanks to her, he could continue in virtue.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000038_000002.wav|174|This idea had ended in teaching a child to read.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000017_000000.wav|174|Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty five years he had been alone in the world.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000038_000000.wav|174|Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read.

dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000040_000001.wav|174|And then he talked of her mother, and he made her pray.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000042_000002.wav|174|He saw a whole future stretching out before him, illuminated by Cosette as by a charming light.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000029_000001.wav|174|The entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God.
dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000022_000001.wav|174|The Bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; Cosette caused the dawn of love to rise.

dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000004_000004.wav|8842|Whereof I wrote this poem:--
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000012_000000.wav|8842|After this empty imagining, it happened on a day, as I sat thoughtful, that I was taken with such a strong trembling at the heart, that it could not have been otherwise in the presence of my lady.
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000001_000000.wav|8842|A few days after this, my body became afflicted with a painful infirmity, whereby I suffered bitter anguish for many days, which at last brought me unto such weakness that I could no longer move.
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000002_000008.wav|8842|And so strong was my phantasy, that I wept again in very truth, and said with my true voice: "O excellent soul! how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee!"
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000011_000003.wav|8842|The second part begins here, "I was a thinking." The first part divides into two.
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000011_000001.wav|8842|In the first, speaking to a person undefined, I tell how I was aroused from a vain phantasy by certain ladies, and how I promised them to tell what it was.
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000002_000003.wav|8842|She that was thine excellent lady hath been taken out of life." Then I began to weep very piteously; and not only in mine imagination, but with mine eyes, which were wet with tears.
dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000004_000003.wav|8842|Also, after I had recovered from my sickness, I bethought me to write these things in rhyme; deeming it a lovely thing to be known.

dev-clean/8297/275154/8297_275154_000008_000004.wav|8297|And yet he spoke roughly; he looked like an angry man brought to bay.

dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000013_000006.wav|8297|Have you seen Catherine lately?"
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000021_000002.wav|8297|It was for the Captain to confirm what mrs Presty had said of him, if he thought it desirable to touch on the subject in his reply.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000000.wav|8297|The serious embarrassments that surrounded him were thickening fast.

dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000003_000001.wav|8297|Herbert was satisfied.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000027_000002.wav|8297|No explanation of the cause of this delay followed.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000020_000000.wav|8297|Even this apparently simple proceeding required examination in its different bearings, before he could begin his letter.

dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000004.wav|8297|Add to this, that his confidence in Catherine had been rudely shaken.

dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000019_000001.wav|8297|To perform that promise appeared to be now simply impossible.

dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000021_000000.wav|8297|Would he be justified in alluding to the report which associated Bennydeck with Catherine?

dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000002_000000.wav|8297|"What are you doing here?" he asked.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000019_000007.wav|8297|He decided on hastening Sydney's introduction to Bennydeck, and on writing at once to prepare the Captain for that event.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000026_000000.wav|8297|The first which he happened to take up was addressed to him in mrs Presty's handwriting.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000001.wav|8297|His natural frank nature urged him to undeceive Herbert.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000016_000000.wav|8297|"Leave that to me," was the one reply which Randal could venture to make at the moment.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000007_000000.wav|8297|He snatched a newspaper out of his pocket as he spoke-tore it in half-and threw it away.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000013_000005.wav|8297|No more of it now.
dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000012_000000.wav|8297|"Don't be angry; and do pray remember that the Divorce allows you and Catherine to marry again, if you like."
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000013_000000.wav|8297|"I am indeed sorry to spoil your dramatic effect," she said.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000036_000000.wav|8297|"That will do, mrs Presty.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000022_000002.wav|8297|"And would you have seen your child made to suffer as well as yourself?"
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000025_000000.wav|8297|"I should have told the truth."

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000009_000000.wav|8297|"It depends on you to decide that," Randal replied.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000008_000003.wav|8297|Her keen penetration discovered something in his face which checked the gayety of her welcome.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000039_000003.wav|8297|Have you any message for Captain Bennydeck?"

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000028_000005.wav|8297|I have ship wrecked Herbert as the shortest way of answering inconvenient questions.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000034_000001.wav|8297|"And how did Catherine answer you?" he inquired.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000015_000000.wav|8297|"You are to understand that Catherine is a widow.

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000044_000000.wav|8297|It was a relief to Randal-in the present state of Catherine's relations toward Bennydeck-to return to London without having seen his friend.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000015_000001.wav|8297|I say it with pride, a widow of my making!"
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000024_000005.wav|8297|When he and I happened to be left together he naturally wondered, after having seen the beautiful wife, where the lucky husband might be.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000013_000006.wav|8297|What a perfect gentleman!"

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000019_000001.wav|8297|He's an obstacle in our way, and we have been compelled to get rid of him."
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000040_000000.wav|8297|Randal asked if his friend was then at the hotel.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000046_000002.wav|8297|Will it be of any use if we invite you to the marriage?"

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000020_000001.wav|8297|mrs Presty's audacity was something more than he could understand.

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000022_000000.wav|8297|Having related the circumstances, she suggested that Randal should put himself in Catherine's place, before he ventured on expressing an opinion.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000011_000000.wav|8297|Randal handed his paper to her, open at the right place.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000039_000000.wav|8297|mrs Presty recovered all her audacity.

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000004_000001.wav|8297|He read the paragraph in which it appeared.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000024_000006.wav|8297|If he had asked you about mr Norman, how would you have answered him?"
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000008_000002.wav|8297|"How nice of you to come so soon!" she began.

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000011_000001.wav|8297|"There is my news," he said.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000003_000005.wav|8297|Randal bought it.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000028_000007.wav|8297|Worse stories have been printed; I do assure you, worse stories have been printed."
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000033_000002.wav|8297|I said, 'Will you let Kitty see her father again?'"
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000010_000003.wav|8297|Out with it!"
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000038_000000.wav|8297|Randal passed this over without notice.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000020_000000.wav|8297|Randal drew back a step.

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000013_000005.wav|8297|The author only says, 'It's whispered.' How delicate of him!

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000021_000000.wav|8297|"Sit down," said mrs Presty.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000006_000001.wav|8297|Randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph.

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000020_000002.wav|8297|"Is this woman mad?" he said to himself.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000006_000000.wav|8297|The allusion to Bennydeck was too plain to be mistaken.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000042_000000.wav|8297|"Where is he?"
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000036_000001.wav|8297|Your defense is thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects."
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000029_000001.wav|8297|"Have you done all this with Catherine's consent?" he asked as he got up from his chair.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000023_000000.wav|8297|"I should have kept in retirement for the future," he answered, "and not have trusted my child and myself among strangers in hotels."
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000021_000003.wav|8297|Very well.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000041_000000.wav|8297|mrs Presty smiled significantly.

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000029_000000.wav|8297|Randal decided on leaving her.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000045_000000.wav|8297|He took leave of mrs Presty with the formality due to a stranger-he merely bowed.

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000024_000001.wav|8297|And you would have condemned your poor little daughter to solitude?
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000033_000000.wav|8297|"Wait a minute," she answered.

dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000035_000000.wav|8297|"Honestly.
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000031_000000.wav|8297|"Does she submit to your telling Kitty that her father is dead?"
dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000024_000002.wav|8297|You would have seen her pining for the company of other children, and would have had no mercy on her?

dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000017_000002.wav|2428|It is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000038_000006.wav|2428|If she had been like me they would have rent us limb from limb.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000032_000001.wav|2428|Hers has been prodigious.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000031_000000.wav|2428|I endeavoured to.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000040_000000.wav|2428|Nothing could be more delightful.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000001_000000.wav|2428|I did not mean to kiss her; it was a pure accident.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000002_000001.wav|2428|To begin with she had six brothers and five sisters, and she is the eldest of the batch, and there's not one of the brothers whom I feel drawn to.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000018_000004.wav|2428|The matter was talked about at dinner.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000025_000002.wav|2428|I found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000007_000000.wav|2428|The accident in question occurred upon the Sunday evening.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000025_000000.wav|2428|Such an assurance was most satisfactory.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000036_000001.wav|2428|I cannot pretend to explain why, except on the supposition that romance is dead; at least in that circle of society in which the Snellings move.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000039_000003.wav|2428|A second cousin of Mary Ann's is in the Cook's Tours line.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000015_000002.wav|2428|I was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of Mary Ann's engagement ring.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000001_000002.wav|2428|Whiting, may I ask what is the meaning of this?" I said it meant nothing-nothing!
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000038_000002.wav|2428|On the other hand, she is well qualified to protect me from the rest of the family.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000018_000005.wav|2428|Mary Ann was silent for some time; then she quietly remarked:
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000001_000005.wav|2428|Her manner was not at all the sort of thing I care for. The result is that I am engaged to Mary Ann Snelling without being conscious of having entertained any intention of the kind.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000020_000000.wav|2428|This observation was followed by perfect silence.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000005_000001.wav|2428|All, apparently, that is left for me to do, is to pay for everything.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000000_000000.wav|2428|mr
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000005_000003.wav|2428|It might just as well be some one else's wedding, so unimportant is the part which I am set to play in it.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000027_000000.wav|2428|It turned out that she had a little money of her own; about a hundred and thirty pounds a year.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000039_000001.wav|2428|It is to take place on Tuesday fortnight.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000036_000002.wav|2428|But that is not the only society the world contains.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000032_000002.wav|2428|It is certain that we have a large collection of really valuable property about the house-the wedding presents to Mary Ann.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000007_000005.wav|2428|I was not pressed for time.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000019_000001.wav|2428|I shall do nothing of the kind."
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000026_000000.wav|2428|I told her exactly what my income was; and the source from which it came, and all about it.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000007_000004.wav|2428|Nor did I take any steps in that direction during the whole of that week.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000011_000000.wav|2428|I gasped-positively gasped.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000027_000001.wav|2428|And, of course, I had my expectations, and she had hers.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000001_000003.wav|2428|Absolutely nothing!
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000023_000001.wav|2428|But she went on with the most perfect fluency.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000038_000008.wav|2428|And they know it!
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000032_000003.wav|2428|She has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants, which is a little short of miraculous.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000030_000002.wav|2428|I have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present, and I shall tell them what they ought to give-it won't be my fault if I don't get it.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000009_000001.wav|2428|Each of them twice my size and all of them frightfully ignorant and wholly regardless of the sensitive little points of those with whom they came in contact.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000039_000000.wav|2428|p s--The cards are out for the wedding.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000027_000002.wav|2428|It was plain that together we should manage most comfortably.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000028_000001.wav|2428|'A bird in the hand is worth two in a bush'--and it will be something to have by us."
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000016_000002.wav|2428|Still I noticed that the ring fitted her perfectly, and I could not but wonder if she had tried it on before.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000018_000001.wav|2428|The woman's name is Brady.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000006_000001.wav|2428|I deny that for the last six months I have been using mr Snelling's home as if it were a boarding house.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000023_000002.wav|2428|There were no signs of faltering about her flow of language.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000010_000000.wav|2428|"Look here, Whiting, how about Mary Ann's ring?
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000034_000002.wav|2428|"And what," inquired mrs Macpherson, "has Mary Ann given you?"
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000039_000006.wav|2428|So that, as Mary Ann says, our honeymoon need cost us practically nothing.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000030_000003.wav|2428|Of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain, but I shall be as plain as I can; there's a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000002_000002.wav|2428|Her father is a most remarkable person, to say the least.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000039_000004.wav|2428|He has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey, and all the way back again; and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000015_000000.wav|2428|They produced the ring, and told me what I had to pay for it.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000010_000001.wav|2428|The girl is fretting, but you don't seem to notice it.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000035_000000.wav|2428|"Her love."
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000039_000005.wav|2428|It's a wedding present.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000033_000002.wav|2428|The fact of having given Mary Ann a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which, to me, is inexplicable.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000021_000001.wav|2428|Mary Ann beamed at me, and she said, "You dear old man!" Presently she continued:
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000037_000001.wav|2428|It is true that they are a trifle large for me, and that I shall never be able to keep them on my feet except when I am sitting still.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000034_000001.wav|2428|I have given Mary Ann two or three trifles, and I said so.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000006_000005.wav|2428|The alteration which has taken place in their demeanour since my accident with Mary Ann is, therefore, all the more amazing.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000003_000001.wav|2428|I do not know what he meant, and would rather not attempt to imagine.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000013_000001.wav|2428|From a cousin of ours who's in that line."
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000038_000007.wav|2428|As it is, unless I am mistaken, some of the rending will be on our side.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000023_000000.wav|2428|I endeavoured to explain to her that I felt sure of it; but I fear that my explanation was a little stumbling.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000030_000001.wav|2428|I will take care that my relations do their duty.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000018_000002.wav|2428|There she owns a cottage, or it may be a pigstye for all I know.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000015_000001.wav|2428|A handsome price it was.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000027_000003.wav|2428|Delightfully, in fact.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000039_000002.wav|2428|We are going for our honeymoon to Italy and the South of France.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000013_000000.wav|2428|"That's it; on your account.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000000_000001.wav|2428|WHITING AND MARY ANN.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000018_000000.wav|2428|The Snellings have an aunt who lives in an out of the way hole at the other end of nowhere.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000008_000000.wav|2428|Besides, I was turning things over in my mind.
dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000015_000004.wav|2428|I did not want any unpleasantness; and I am quite sure there would have been unpleasantness had I demurred.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000008_000003.wav|2428|It appeared that the terms would be five guineas; but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000011_000005.wav|2428|Hardly the sort of weather to start for an unknown destination "in the heart of the country." But, at the last moment, I did not like to back out.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000010_000001.wav|2428|No doubt the five guineas were badly wanted; even a "lively family" would be hardly likely to advertise for a perfect stranger to spend Christmas with them if they were not.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000043_000001.wav|2428|There be a lot of luggage. He do say he's come to stay with you."
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000009_000003.wav|2428|And yet, from my boyhood upward, I have desired to meet one. Here was an opportunity offered.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000011_000002.wav|2428|In the morning it began to freeze.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000029_000003.wav|2428|No answer; though I allowed a more than decent interval.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000029_000000.wav|2428|There appeared to be no knocker, though whether it had been "twisted" off was more than I could say.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000003_000000.wav|2428|AN old-fashioned CHRISTMAS.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000012_000003.wav|2428|I am no dealer in poisons.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000039_000004.wav|2428|After a few seconds' interval the pit pat of what was obviously one pair of feet came towards the door.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000013_000001.wav|2428|The youngest member of the family might be twenty, or the oldest ten.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000039_000002.wav|2428|I had not come all that way, and subjected myself to so much discomfort, to be played tricks with.

dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000008_000001.wav|2428|The reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000017_000004.wav|2428|Never shall I forget the drive, in that miserable cart, through the storm and those pitch black country lanes.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000017_000000.wav|2428|There was a trap at the "Boy and Blunderbuss," but that required fetching.

dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000005.wav|2428|Then I had to wait three quarters of an hour for a train to take me back again, only to find that I had missed the one I intended to catch.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000011_000004.wav|2428|And it kept on snowing; that turned out to be quite a record in the way of snow storms.

dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000024_000001.wav|2428|I did not ask.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000042_000000.wav|2428|That was all she said.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000007_000001.wav|2428|It had its points.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000042_000001.wav|2428|I looked at her; she at me.
dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000007.wav|2428|It is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that I made it warm for the officials, however cold I might have been myself.

dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000021_000000.wav|2428|There was something in the tone of his "Ah!" which whetted my curiosity, near the end of my tether though I was.

dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000014_000006.wav|2428|I would not give him pills.

dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000057_000001.wav|6313|After winding the end tightly about his own arm, he handed a lighted torch to Tad.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000076_000000.wav|6313|Then followed a long period of suspense.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000047_000002.wav|6313|You are----"
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000061_000000.wav|6313|"Good!" approved Lige encouragingly, beginning to let the rawhide slip slowly around the trunk of the tree.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000029_000000.wav|6313|There was no response.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000070_000001.wav|6313|But he doesn't answer me."
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000034_000003.wav|6313|But I don't dare try it.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000061_000001.wav|6313|As he did so, Tad felt himself gradually sinking into the sombre depths.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000019_000000.wav|6313|"Yes," agreed Tad, "that does look like bushes.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000053_000000.wav|6313|"Are you ready?"
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000017_000002.wav|6313|Where is it that you think you see bushes?"
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000023_000001.wav|6313|"It's a tough job.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000024_000000.wav|6313|"Why not get a rope and let it down to him," suggested Tad.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000042_000000.wav|6313|"In that case, you will have to go yourself, Thomas," decided the Professor sharply.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000036_000000.wav|6313|"Fainted, probably.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000048_000000.wav|6313|"I am needed right here, sir," replied the guide, shortly.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000068_000000.wav|6313|"I see him," called Tad, his voice sounding hollow and unnatural to those above.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000054_000000.wav|6313|"Yes."
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000070_000000.wav|6313|"Lodged in the branches of a pinyon tree, I think it is.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000082_000001.wav|6313|Tell them Walt's all right.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000052_000000.wav|6313|"I understand."
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000011_000003.wav|6313|But I don't know how we are going to get him."
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000019_000005.wav|6313|Stick tight and don't get scared.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000025_000001.wav|6313|Run over to the cook tent and tell Jose to give you those rawhide lariats that he will find behind his bunk.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000032_000001.wav|6313|They gazed at each other in perplexity.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000084_000000.wav|6313|"Sure thing!" answered the boy.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000016_000002.wav|6313|Can you make it out?"
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000002_000001.wav|6313|Running to the edge of the cliff, he leaned over and listened intently.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000045_000001.wav|6313|"It will be better for him to go, if he will----"
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000076_000001.wav|6313|But from the cautious movements of the light far below them, the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000073_000001.wav|6313|Now try it."
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000044_000001.wav|6313|"I am the one to go after Walt, if anyone has to.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000071_000000.wav|6313|"Wait a minute," cautioned the mountaineer.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000043_000000.wav|6313|"Let me go, mr Thomas," interrupted Ned Rector, stepping forward, with almost a challenge in his eyes.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000005_000000.wav|6313|"Keep back!
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000018_000000.wav|6313|"Over there to the right, just near the edge of the light space made by the torch light," answered the guide.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000020_000000.wav|6313|"Don't move around.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000007_000002.wav|6313|Don't move an inch.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000078_000000.wav|6313|"Keep still!
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000009_000000.wav|6313|"Down there, sir," explained Tad, pointing to the ledge of rock over which Walter had fallen.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000067_000001.wav|6313|Got him?" he answered, leaning over the cliff.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000059_000000.wav|6313|"Right!" announced the guide in a reassuring voice.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000034_000005.wav|6313|I don't dare try any experiments."
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000037_000001.wav|6313|We've got to get Walt up here, even if I have to jump over after him," said Tad firmly.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000036_000003.wav|6313|Ain't no use to expect him to hook himself onto the line, even if he does wake up," decided the guide with emphasis, beginning to haul up the lariat, which he coiled neatly on the rock in front of him.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000040_000000.wav|6313|"One of us must go down there," was the guide's startling announcement.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000045_000000.wav|6313|"Master Tad is right," decided the guide, gazing at the two boys approvingly.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000019_000002.wav|6313|Hey, Walter!
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000017_000001.wav|6313|All I can see is rocks and shadows.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000028_000001.wav|6313|Let me know when the rope reaches you.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000062_000000.wav|6313|He tilted his head to look up.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000015_000000.wav|6313|"See anything?" asked Tad tremulously, creeping to his side.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000064_000001.wav|6313|"Better lie down so you, too, don't take a notion to fall off.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000090_000001.wav|6313|Closing his eyes, he clung to the slender support with grim courage until a hail from above told him that the rawhide loop was rapidly squirming down toward him.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000013_000001.wav|6313|What are we going to do, Thomas-how are we to rescue the boy?"
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000051_000005.wav|6313|If you find the support too weak to bear your weight, let me know.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000028_000000.wav|6313|"Hello, down there!
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000051_000006.wav|6313|I'll send down another rope to which you can tie yourself until we get Master Walter to the top.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000058_000000.wav|6313|It was a trying moment for all of them, and naturally more so for the boy who was about to descend into the unknown depths of the mountain canyou.
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000001_000000.wav|6313|A DARING RESCUE
dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000020_000001.wav|6313|Lie perfectly still," warned the guide.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000046_000000.wav|6313|"I think I'll ride my own pony and let the dog walk," announced Ned.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000093_000000.wav|6313|"Are you hurt?" asked Tad apprehensively.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000074_000003.wav|6313|"I've seen them do that in the wild west shows too many times not to know how myself."
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000050_000002.wav|6313|The trail is so plainly marked that he can't miss it."
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000036_000004.wav|6313|Next thing we know you'll be providing us with bear steak."
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000062_000001.wav|6313|He slapped Texas sharply on the flank with the flat of his hand.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000037_000001.wav|6313|"Are there bears up here?"
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000074_000002.wav|6313|I can do that myself," he grunted.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000043_000000.wav|6313|This announcement filled the boys with excitement.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000045_000002.wav|6313|We shall need a dog.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000081_000000.wav|6313|Stacy dismounted and removed the hat carefully to one side.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000065_000001.wav|6313|Even Stacy Brown, though he did not sit his saddle with the same grace that marked the riding of Tad Butler and Ned Rector, more practiced horsemen, was nevertheless no mean rider.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000048_000000.wav|6313|As yet, they had been unable to attempt any fancy riding with their ponies, owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000038_000003.wav|6313|I came near losing my life too, and----"
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000077_000000.wav|6313|"I will," replied Chunky, confidently.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000055_000000.wav|6313|They assured him that nothing was further from their intention, and quickly casting aside guns and cartridge belts, they threw themselves into their saddles again for a jolly romp.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000036_000001.wav|6313|"I'd lose my dignity for a mouthful of that, any day," he decided after having sampled the combination. "President Brown, I withdraw my criticism.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000052_000000.wav|6313|An early start was made, so that the party reached the promised table lands shortly before ten o'clock in the forenoon.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000057_000001.wav|6313|"Suppose we start with a race?
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000029_000000.wav|6313|"Yes."
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000085_000001.wav|6313|You don't have to move the hat, you ninny."
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000045_000000.wav|6313|"That depends.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000002_000000.wav|6313|ROUGH RIDERS IN THE SADDLE
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000079_000001.wav|6313|Guess I know how to ride.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000079_000000.wav|6313|"Don't you worry about me, Ned Rector.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000023_000001.wav|6313|"But what's this!
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000027_000003.wav|6313|We sometimes had jam when I was with the German----"
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000057_000002.wav|6313|We'll race the length of the field and back.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000088_000000.wav|6313|"Be careful, Chunky," warned Walter.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000004_000002.wav|6313|He no doubt would bring food of some kind with him.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000074_000000.wav|6313|"Huh!
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000064_000000.wav|6313|The third heat was merely a repetition of the second.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000080_000001.wav|6313|Riding bravely out into the field, he tossed it to the ground.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000027_000000.wav|6313|"Now, fall to, young gentlemen," directed the Professor.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000027_000002.wav|6313|I think I shall help myself to some of that wild plum jam and biscuit, first It reminds me of old times.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000045_000001.wav|6313|Perhaps Tuesday.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000051_000000.wav|6313|The boys were now all anxiety to start, while the ponies, after their Sunday rest, were almost as full of life as were their owners.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000040_000002.wav|6313|Besides this, there are many abandoned mines up the range further.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000031_000000.wav|6313|Chunky did even better than that.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000049_000000.wav|6313|The guide said that, by making a detour in their journey that day, they would cross table lands several acres in extent and covered with grass.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000013_000000.wav|6313|"We did not.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000025_000000.wav|6313|"Yes; wild plum jam," answered the guide.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000075_000000.wav|6313|Walter smiled, with a twinkle in his eyes.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000071_000001.wav|6313|Grasping the pommel with the left hand, he appeared to dive head first toward the ground.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000010_000000.wav|6313|"Had anything to eat!" asked the guide.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000044_000000.wav|6313|"What I want to know, is, when do we go hunting?" asked Ned.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000058_000000.wav|6313|To this all agreed.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000012_000000.wav|6313|"But I left you a rabbit.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000040_000000.wav|6313|"Yes, the country is full of caves.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000034_000000.wav|6313|Chunky colored.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000039_000000.wav|6313|"A cave?" interrupted Tad.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000091_000000.wav|6313|At the moment when he freed his left foot from the stirrup, he threw his body sharply to the right, reaching for the hat without taking the precaution to grasp the pommel.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000054_000001.wav|6313|"I guess I had better go along to see that you do not."
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000092_000002.wav|6313|Chunky turned a double somersault, lay still for a moment, then struggled up, rubbing his body gingerly, as the rest of the party came hurrying up to him.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000065_000000.wav|6313|By this time, the boys had come to feel fully as much at home in the saddle as they formerly had been out of it.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000042_000000.wav|6313|"All you want.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000008_000000.wav|6313|"Now you may go," he nodded.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000076_000000.wav|6313|"Why not show us, then?" he said.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000052_000001.wav|6313|A temporary camp was quickly pitched.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000021_000001.wav|6313|Why, mr Thomas, where did you get honey?" asked Walter.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000033_000000.wav|6313|"Remember, sir, that a certain amount of dignity befits the office of president of the Pony Riders Club," he said.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000064_000001.wav|6313|All agreed that Tad's superior horsemanship, alone, had won the race for him.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000028_000000.wav|6313|"Army," added Ned.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000062_000000.wav|6313|Tad hitched in his saddle a little, throwing the greater part of his weight on the stirrups.
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000011_000001.wav|6313|"Cold water is the most nourishing thing we've touched since last night."
dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000032_000000.wav|6313|Ned fixed him with a stern eye.

dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000020_000001.wav|3752|I should say so!" returned Burgess, with a laugh, modelled upon Maurice Frere's own.
dev-clean/3752/4943/3752_4943_000003_000007.wav|3752|Kirkland belonged to a Methodist family and owned a piety utterly out of place in that region.

dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000022_000002.wav|84|"Yes, yes," continued Morrel; "recall the scene, for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000021_000000.wav|84|"Oh, you rave, sir," exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000015_000000.wav|84|"I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office."
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000012_000006.wav|84|But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth-she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000042_000000.wav|84|"Yes."
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000011_000004.wav|84|At length, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping, tears glistened in the eyes of Noirtier.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000027_000000.wav|84|"Yes," replied Noirtier.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000062_000003.wav|84|For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000062_000006.wav|84|D'Avrigny accosted the priest.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000008_000002.wav|84|His glance, at first wandering, fixed itself upon Morrel.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000008_000000.wav|84|Villefort rose, half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000012_000007.wav|84|Take a last farewell, sir, of her sad remains; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own, and then separate yourself from her forever.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000008_000001.wav|84|The terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000008_000004.wav|84|"Go!--do you hear?" said Villefort, while d'Avrigny advanced to lead Morrel out.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000062_000001.wav|84|You will excuse me, will you not?
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000057_000000.wav|84|"Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?" asked d'Avrigny.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000054_000000.wav|84|It was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair of Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000009_000000.wav|84|But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000036_000000.wav|84|"no"
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000061_000000.wav|84|"Do you wish to see him?"
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000011_000003.wav|84|One could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000067_000000.wav|84|"I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000043_000000.wav|84|"But can he understand you?"
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000066_000000.wav|84|"It is a young girl."
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000050_000001.wav|84|Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000054_000005.wav|84|Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and silent as the corpse.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000054_000004.wav|84|The two doctors, therefore, entered the room alone.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000007_000001.wav|84|Maximilian.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000019_000001.wav|84|I am stricken by fate.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000020_000004.wav|84|I tell you that the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time it has succeeded.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000045_000003.wav|84|"You can come," he said, and led them back to Noirtier. Morrel looked attentively on Villefort.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000034_000000.wav|84|"Yes."
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000056_000005.wav|84|Villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few words thanked the district doctor, he turned to d'Avrigny, and said,--"And now the priest."
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000058_000000.wav|84|"no" said Villefort; "fetch the nearest."
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000053_000001.wav|84|We have before stated that all the servants had fled.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000030_000000.wav|84|"Yes," replied Noirtier.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000017_000004.wav|84|"Yes," indicated the old man.
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000065_000000.wav|84|"I was about to offer myself, sir," said the priest; "it is our mission to forestall our duties."
dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000020_000002.wav|84|"And I say that murders are committed here," said Morrel, whose voice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: "I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months.
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000016_000003.wav|6319|And yet what could he mean by the bones of our mother?"
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000018_000001.wav|6319|"Let us go on down the mountain, and as we go, let us pick up the stones in our path and throw them over our shoulders behind us."
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000016_000000.wav|6319|"Surely I do not know," said Deucalion.
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000008_000001.wav|6319|Be sure that you are ready for it, my son."
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000016_000002.wav|6319|Who is our mother, if it is not the Earth, from whom all living things have sprung?
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000019_000000.wav|6319|"It is rather a silly thing to do," said Deucalion; "and yet there can be no harm in it, and we shall see what will happen."
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000011_000002.wav|6319|While they were talking and trying to think what they should do, they heard a voice behind them.
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000007_000001.wav|6319|Once every year he had gone to the land of the Caucasus to talk with his father, who was hanging chained to the mountain peak.
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000018_000000.wav|6319|"Perhaps he meant the stones of the earth," said Pyrrha.
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000016_000001.wav|6319|"But let us think a moment.
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000005_000000.wav|6319|"These men," he said to his mighty company, "are nothing but a source of trouble.
dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000012_000000.wav|6319|"Is there anything that you wish?" he asked.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000014.wav|6319|Her hand lay upon her breast, and he touched his lips to it.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000011_000001.wav|6319|The king came forward to receive her and showed his grief.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000003_000001.wav|6319|Before each was set a magnificent plate, with a gold knife and a gold fork studded with diamonds and rubies.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000013_000004.wav|6319|The prince did not know what to believe, when finally an old peasant said:
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000008.wav|6319|The men had plainly fallen asleep.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000015.wav|6319|At that moment, the enchantment being ended, the princess awoke, and, looking drowsily and tenderly at the young man, said:
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000005_000001.wav|6319|It is true I cannot entirely undo what my elder has done.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000016_000000.wav|6319|"Have you come, my prince?
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000004_000001.wav|6319|The fairies now began to endow the princess.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000013_000000.wav|6319|A hundred years went by, and the kingdom was in the hands of another royal family.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000007.wav|6319|But the faces of the men were rosy, and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000012_000001.wav|6319|The king and queen kissed their daughter farewell and left the castle, issuing a proclamation that no person whatsoever was to approach it.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000013_000001.wav|6319|The son of the king was hunting one day when he discovered the towers of the castle above the tops of the trees, and asked what castle that was.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000011_000002.wav|6319|The good fairy was very wise and saw that the princess when she woke would find herself all alone in that great castle and everything about her would be strange.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000002_000001.wav|6319|When at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast, the like of which had never before been known.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000016_000002.wav|6319|The prince was overjoyed at the words, and at the tender voice and look, and scarcely knew how to speak.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000005_000003.wav|6319|The sleep will last a hundred years, and at the end of that time a king's son will come to wake her."
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000018_000000.wav|6319|When they left the castle the next day to return to the prince's home, they were followed by all the retinue of the princess.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000005_000002.wav|6319|The princess will pierce her hand with a spindle, but, instead of dying, she will only fall into a deep sleep.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000016_000003.wav|6319|But he managed to assure her of his love, and they soon forgot all else as they talked and talked.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000009_000000.wav|6319|"I am spinning, my fair child," said the old woman, who did not know her.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000001.wav|6319|He had not a moment's doubt that he was destined to this great adventure, and full of ardour he determined at once to set out for the castle.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000007.wav|6319|He knew that she would not awake for a hundred years.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000013.wav|6319|He drew near, trembling and wondering, and knelt beside her.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000010.wav|6319|He entered the guard room; there the guards stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders, but they were sound asleep.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000000.wav|6319|The young prince at these words felt himself on fire.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000012_000000.wav|6319|It was the work of a moment.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000002_000000.wav|6319|Once upon a time there was a king and a queen who grieved sorely that they had no children.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000011_000003.wav|6319|So this is what she did.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000011_000007.wav|6319|Even the spits before the fire, laden with partridges and pheasants, went to sleep, and the fire itself went to sleep also.

dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000018_000001.wav|6319|They marched down the long avenue, and the wood opened again to let them pass.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000006.wav|6319|The king looked sorrowfully upon her.

dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000017_000001.wav|6319|The lady in waiting became very impatient, and at length announced to the princess that they all waited for her.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000004.wav|6319|People came running in from all sides; they threw water in the princess's face and did all they could to restore her, but nothing would bring her to.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000000.wav|6319|"How pretty it is!" exclaimed the princess.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000013_000002.wav|6319|All manner of answers were given to him.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000008_000000.wav|6319|"What are you doing?" asked the princess.
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000001.wav|6319|"How do you do it?
dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000011.wav|6319|He passed through one apartment after another, where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing.

dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000036_000002.wav|1462|I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000040_000001.wav|1462|Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000009_000000.wav|1462|Hilda took a quick, soft breath.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000041_000001.wav|1462|She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000043_000006.wav|1462|I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here with you.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000003.wav|1462|The room was empty when he entered.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000028_000000.wav|1462|Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000008.wav|1462|"Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day!
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000042_000007.wav|1462|The shamefulness of your asking me to do that!
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000047_000000.wav|1462|She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000029_000001.wav|1462|"I meant to, but somehow I couldn't.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000040_000004.wav|1462|What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg."
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000005_000001.wav|1462|I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train."
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000043_000003.wav|1462|I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don't dare trifle with it.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000043_000001.wav|1462|"Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid of myself.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000038_000001.wav|1462|I was wrong.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000042_000008.wav|1462|If you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000042_000005.wav|1462|Keep away if you wish; when have I ever followed you?
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000033_000000.wav|1462|"Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000011_000001.wav|1462|At last Alexander brought out one word:--
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000038_000006.wav|1462|"You want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people?
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000039_000000.wav|1462|"I can't," he said heavily.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000021_000002.wav|1462|"Each life spoils the other.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000008_000001.wav|1462|"It's the whole thing that troubles me, Hilda.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000011.wav|1462|I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000012.wav|1462|But why do you let me chatter on like this?
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000024_000001.wav|1462|"It was myself I was defying, Hilda.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000043_000005.wav|1462|It's different now.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000013_000001.wav|1462|She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000040_000003.wav|1462|I can't see you at all, anywhere.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000029_000000.wav|1462|Alexander groaned.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000044_000005.wav|1462|I will do anything you say-but that!
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000001_000002.wav|1462|He had planned to stop in Liverpool; but, instead, he took the boat train for London.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000001_000001.wav|1462|The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000016_000001.wav|1462|He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000006_000001.wav|1462|Hilda watched him with perplexity.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000006_000000.wav|1462|Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000048_000000.wav|1462|"Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000027_000001.wav|1462|The first was-sort of in play, wasn't it?"
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000043_000004.wav|1462|It's getting the better of me.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000019_000000.wav|1462|"Always.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000027_000000.wav|1462|"After the very first.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000021_000003.wav|1462|I get nothing but misery out of either.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000022_000001.wav|1462|She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000024_000000.wav|1462|He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000043_000002.wav|1462|I don't trust myself any more.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000042_000009.wav|1462|Do you understand?
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000033_000001.wav|1462|"Please tell me one thing, Bartley.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000030_000000.wav|1462|"Yes, I was happy, wasn't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Weren't you happy then, at all?"
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000017_000000.wav|1462|Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows growing about her eyes.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000040_000002.wav|1462|"It's got to be a clean break, Hilda.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000031_000000.wav|1462|She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000031_000001.wav|1462|Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000025_000000.wav|1462|He looked at her and his haggard face softened.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000001_000000.wav|1462|The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000046_000000.wav|1462|"Just something Bartley.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000037_000000.wav|1462|Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000046_000001.wav|1462|I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000046_000007.wav|1462|Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding-hard as a steel spring.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000023_000000.wav|1462|"Could you-could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?"
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000032_000002.wav|1462|But afterward. . ."
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000022_000000.wav|1462|At that word "deception," spoken with such self contempt, the color flashed back into Hilda's face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000025_000001.wav|1462|He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000001.wav|1462|When Marie met him at the door, even her strong sense of the proprieties could not restrain her surprise and delight.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000042_000002.wav|1462|Do you hear me, Bartley? It's too late.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000004.wav|1462|A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000031_000002.wav|1462|He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000008_000000.wav|1462|Bartley bent lower over the fire.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000044_000004.wav|1462|And I've got nobody but you.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000019_000003.wav|1462|It tortures me every minute."
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000042_000003.wav|1462|I won't promise.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000012_000000.wav|1462|"Everything!"
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000024_000002.wav|1462|I have thought about it until I am worn out."
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000033_000002.wav|1462|At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy."
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000044_000000.wav|1462|Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000010.wav|1462|I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along.
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000026_000001.wav|1462|"When did you first begin to feel like this, Bartley?"
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000004_000001.wav|1462|You haven't spoken a word."
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000013.wav|1462|Come over to the fire; you're chilled through."
dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000009.wav|1462|I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000020_000003.wav|1462|I'm too fond of him."
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000017_000002.wav|1462|Then, when your manager added two more weeks, I was already committed." He dropped upon the stool in front of her and sat with his hands hanging between his knees.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000008_000000.wav|1462|Alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000003_000004.wav|1462|Over the fireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000006_000002.wav|1462|There was something about him that made Hilda wish herself at her hotel again, in the street below, anywhere but where she was.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000032_000003.wav|1462|Only one.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000012_000006.wav|1462|I told myself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of myself, a letter would be better than nothing.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000011_000005.wav|1462|Give me my things, please." She put her hand out toward the fender.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000007_000003.wav|1462|That's all.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000020_000000.wav|1462|"Oh, it doesn't matter much!
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000021_000000.wav|1462|Alexander moved restlessly.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000005_000000.wav|1462|"Come in," he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000007_000002.wav|1462|I saw that interview in the paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I thought I had to see you.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000029_000002.wav|1462|But afterward I shan't have an opportunity to explain, for I shan't be seeing you again."
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000029_000001.wav|1462|I suppose I would better do it without telling you.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000009_000007.wav|1462|But you won't let me write to you, and I had to see you after that letter, that terrible letter you wrote me when you got home."
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000032_000001.wav|1462|She closed her eyes; her lips and eyelids trembled.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000005_000002.wav|1462|"Won't you sit down?"
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000009_000003.wav|1462|I've been through this a hundred times to day.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000025_000000.wav|1462|Alexander flushed angrily.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000011_000000.wav|1462|She was afraid to look up at him.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000014_000003.wav|1462|I've jumped up if the fire crackled.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000026_000000.wav|1462|"Under such circumstances, infinitely!"
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000020_000002.wav|1462|Only not Mac.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000029_000000.wav|1462|She tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot heel down firmly. "No; I'm telling you what I've made up my mind to do.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000014_000004.wav|1462|I think I have felt that you were coming." He bent his face over her hair.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000018_000000.wav|1462|"That's what I wanted to see you about, Bartley.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000008_000001.wav|1462|"Sit down, Hilda; you're wet through.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000018_000003.wav|1462|I'm going to marry."
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000032_000004.wav|1462|And he threw it back at me a second time."
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000001_000000.wav|1462|CHAPTER nine
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000031_000004.wav|1462|"You see, you are different, Hilda.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000031_000002.wav|1462|You are not that kind of woman.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000031_000001.wav|1462|Don't do anything like that rashly." His face grew troubled. "You wouldn't be happy.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000028_000000.wav|1462|"Hilda you'd better think a while longer before you do that.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000030_000000.wav|1462|Alexander started to speak, but caught himself.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000017_000003.wav|1462|"What am I to do, Hilda?"
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000011_000003.wav|1462|"I came to tell you that I'm willing to do as you asked me.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000004_000003.wav|1462|He rose and crossed the room quickly.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000018_000002.wav|1462|Only I'll do it more completely.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000011_000004.wav|1462|But it's no use talking about that now.
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000022_000000.wav|1462|"Indeed I'm not."
dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000013_000004.wav|1462|Then I wouldn't have come."

dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000008_000010.wav|2412|This gave me little uneasiness, for I had no money with me, nor anything which they were at all likely to want, or which I cared about losing.

dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000024_000004.wav|6345|Perhaps I can help you."

dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000023_000000.wav|6345|"It serves me right," she said in excellent, yet unfamiliar, English.

dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000007_000009.wav|6345|She was out of place, and much unwelcome.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000012.wav|6345|I know it, and there is no waking.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000014_000002.wav|6345|But she neither loved the light nor mourned the shadow.

dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000005_000005.wav|6345|At last she fell asleep, and in a moment was dreaming diligently.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000012_000000.wav|6345|But the dead, one of them seized one of her hands, and another the other.

dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000010_000000.wav|6345|Then came the form of her mother, and bent over that of her brother from behind.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000007_000002.wav|6345|At the end of it she was in a place of tombs.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000008.wav|6345|It is nothing.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000004_000006.wav|6345|If for a moment a thing looked the same as before, she wondered vaguely, unconsciously, how it could be.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000007_000003.wav|6345|Terror and a dismay indescribable seized her; she turned and fled back to the company of her kind.

dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000005_000001.wav|6345|Death was a fact.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000016_000002.wav|6345|And the voice said, "Poor child! something has closed the valve between her heart and mine." With that came a pang of intense pain.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000011.wav|6345|Everything is an empty dream of loss.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000012_000004.wav|6345|The dead never spoke to her, and she never spoke to them.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000008_000008.wav|6345|It was all deadness.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000014_000001.wav|6345|She was like a fish in a sea of light.

dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000012_000002.wav|6345|Thus was she borne away captive of her dead, neither willing nor unwilling, of life and death equally careless.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000005_000003.wav|6345|How could she? She had not seen Christ rise; she had never looked upon one of the dead; never heard a voice from the other bank; had received no certain testimony.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000006_000004.wav|6345|Every now and then she came on a little group, or met a party of the guests, as she walked, but none spoke to her, or seemed to see her, and she spoke to none.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000004_000000.wav|6345|That night was the first herald of the coming winter, and blew a cold blast from his horn.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000002.wav|6345|But not a throb went through her heart.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000006_000000.wav|6345|She was one of a large company at a house where she had never been before-a beautiful house with a large garden behind.

dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000007_000000.wav|6345|She found herself at length in an avenue of dark trees, the end of which was far off.

dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000016.wav|6345|Her whole consciousness was merest, all but abstract, loss.
dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000015.wav|6345|Her only life was, that she was lost.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000000.wav|6345|He had asked her to meet him at Cannon Street; he had something to say to her, and at home it was difficult to get a quiet half hour because of her little sisters.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000001.wav|6345|Some great sorrow had come to him.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000045_000000.wav|6345|"Of course, if you like," he said uncomfortably; yet she could see he was glad that she had broken that desolate silence.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000013.wav|6345|Yet perhaps, after all, that is not because of the literary sense. It may be because she loved him.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000049_000000.wav|6345|The fine tact of a noble woman seemed to have deserted her.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000064_000000.wav|6345|"Forgive me, dear," he said.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000006.wav|6345|Well, it was not too late.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000039_000002.wav|6345|So she said-
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000001.wav|6345|And, curiously enough, she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000042_000003.wav|6345|Then he would have had to say something.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000073_000000.wav|6345|So she said-
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000004.wav|6345|She almost said, "Never mind, dear.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000066_000000.wav|6345|"Do you think I'm not sorry now?"
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000065_000001.wav|6345|"Never," she said, her eyes flashing through her tears.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000070_000001.wav|6345|"Do you mean it?" he said, and his tone should have warned her.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000055_000000.wav|6345|"Well?" she said.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000000.wav|6345|He stood up suddenly.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000058_000000.wav|6345|Following the tingle of relief came a sharp, sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000003.wav|6345|What was it, compared with her fears?
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000071_000000.wav|6345|The anger in his eyes frightened her, and the misery of his face wrung her heart; but how could she say-
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000001.wav|6345|And the fact that she was to meet him at Cannon Street Station would almost, she feared, make the meeting itself banal, sordid.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000047_000000.wav|6345|"How frightfully cold it is!"
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000000.wav|6345|SHE was going to meet her lover.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000011.wav|6345|When she did her words did not fit the mouth of the girl in the orchard-but then it would have been May there, and this was January.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000062_000000.wav|6345|"Couldn't help it?
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000002.wav|6345|She only wished for May and the orchard, instead of January and the dingy, dusty waiting room, the plain faced, preoccupied travellers, the dim, desolate weather.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000006.wav|6345|You see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals.

dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000003.wav|6345|The girl in the orchard would have known at a glance.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000044_000000.wav|6345|"I'm freezing," she said suddenly; "let's go and have some tea."
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000052_000001.wav|6345|What had he done-a murder-a bank robbery-married someone else?
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000043_000000.wav|6345|Why on earth didn't he speak?
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000058_000001.wav|6345|These inspired her.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000059_000001.wav|6345|"You don't love me-you've never loved me-I was an idiot to believe you did."
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000002.wav|6345|And she had been sulking!
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000042_000005.wav|6345|And how common and mean that would be compared with the blossoming bough; and besides, the shops they were passing had nothing in the windows except cheap pastry and models of steam engines.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000065_000003.wav|6345|No, it's all over-you've broken my heart and destroyed my faith in human nature. I hope I shall never see you again.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000005.wav|6345|Her hands should have been full of bluebells, and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000050_000001.wav|6345|As soon as the two were alone again he leaned his elbows on the marble and spoke.

dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000042_000002.wav|6345|She could have snapped off a blossoming branch and-and made play with it somehow.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000007.wav|6345|She could begin now.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000004.wav|6345|"Go home and gloat over it all!
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000006.wav|6345|He checked the silly impulse.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000052_000000.wav|6345|This preamble sent a shiver of dread down her spine.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000010.wav|6345|Yet she must speak.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000011.wav|6345|Because Destiny is almost without the literary sense, and Destiny carelessly decreed that he should die of enteric in a wretched hut, without so much as hearing a gun fired.

dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000043_000001.wav|6345|He had never been like this before.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000010.wav|6345|How should she know that he had only told her because he feared that she would anyhow hear it through the indiscretion of the girl in pink, or of that other girl in blue who had seen and smiled?
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000011.wav|6345|How could she guess that he had tuned his confession to the key of what he believed would be an innocent girl's estimate of his misconduct?
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000002.wav|6345|It was a very good exit.

dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000008.wav|6345|But how?
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000002.wav|6345|There's no more to be said; you've betrayed me.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000008.wav|6345|He had told her of the thing as one tells of a crime.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000007.wav|6345|He came towards her; he was five minutes late.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000060_000000.wav|6345|"You know I do," he said; "it was hateful of me-but I couldn't help it."

dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000005.wav|6345|But how could he go back to say, "We are parting for ever; but still, I must insist on the sad pleasure of paying for our tea-for the last time"?
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000074_000001.wav|6345|Good bye!"
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000003.wav|6345|At the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea, and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error.

dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000068_000000.wav|6345|He would come to morrow, however, and then- At present the thing to compass was a dignified parting.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000001.wav|6345|And it's good bye for ever. No-it's only painful for both of us.

dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000040_000000.wav|6345|"Oh, the Embankment, please!" and felt a sting of annoyance and disappointment when he acquiesced.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000005.wav|6345|She would have shared his sorrow, and shown herself "half wife, half angel from heaven" in this dark hour.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000049_000003.wav|6345|I can't bear to see you looking so miserable," and there was another silence.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000048_000000.wav|6345|"Yes, isn't it?" he said.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000000.wav|6345|"Good bye," she said; "I'm going home.

dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000038_000000.wav|6345|"Let's go out," he said.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000004.wav|6345|Her dress was brown, her jacket black, and her hat was home trimmed.

dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000063_000000.wav|6345|He could not say, "And so I am, on the whole," which was what he thought.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000007.wav|6345|She had, to the full limit allowed of her reading and her environment, the literary sense.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000065_000000.wav|6345|Then she rose to the occasion.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000063_000001.wav|6345|Her tears were falling hot and fast between face and veil, for she had talked till she was very sorry indeed for herself.
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000070_000002.wav|6345|"Are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this?"
dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000067_000001.wav|6345|At home she could at least have buried her face in the sofa cushions and resisted all his pleading,--at last, perhaps, letting him take one cold passive hand and shower frantic kisses upon it.

dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000030_000008.wav|2277|She would get in one of the great shops and do well enough until-well, until something happened. Neither of them knew exactly what.
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000026_000000.wav|2277|"No," she said to herself, "he can't come here."
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000008_000000.wav|2277|"It's a big place," he said.
dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000020_000000.wav|2277|"I've got to get up early in the morning, so I'll go to bed," and off he went, disappearing into the dark little bedroom off the hall, for the night.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000011_000000.wav|2277|"You take this to this address," he said, handing him the envelope, "and give it to mrs Hurstwood."
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000017_000001.wav|2277|Hurry right back."
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000003.wav|2277|He thought he would go out and insist on seeing her if she did not send him word of some sort soon.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000052_000001.wav|2277|If he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000003.wav|2277|He was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000032_000002.wav|2277|Meanwhile, he would have time to think.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000000.wav|2277|The boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000005.wav|2277|He could see her meeting the boy at the door and smiling sardonically.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000010.wav|2277|It wasn't possible.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000030_000000.wav|2277|There was no more to be done upon that score that night.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000039_000000.wav|2277|Then he folded it up and put it in his pocket.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000029_000000.wav|2277|Hurstwood scowled fiercely.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000001.wav|2277|He was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000021_000001.wav|2277|He tried to get the interest of things about him, but it was not to be.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000046_000000.wav|2277|That night he dined at Rector's and returned at once to his office.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000004.wav|2277|He was really affected most miserably of all by this desertion.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000028_000000.wav|2277|"She said it was high time."
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000009.wav|2277|He would go to her and tell her all his family complications. He would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her. Surely she couldn't go back on him now?
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000033_000001.wav|2277|How about that now?
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000031_000002.wav|2277|Nothing from his wife, which was pleasant.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000052_000000.wav|2277|So here it was spread out clear before him, and now he knew what to expect.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000002.wav|2277|Every once in a while he would clinch his fingers and tap his foot-signs of the stirring mental process he was undergoing.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000047_000000.wav|2277|On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, james and Hay.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000012_000000.wav|2277|"Yes, sir," said the boy.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000004_000000.wav|2277|CHAPTER twenty five
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000032_000000.wav|2277|The fact that he had sent the money and that she had received it worked to the ease of his mind, for, as the thought that he had done it receded, his chagrin at it grew less and his hope of peace more.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000013_000000.wav|2277|"If she isn't there bring it back."
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000005.wav|2277|He got back to his office and joined in a conversation with friends.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000008.wav|2277|He breathed heavily and wiped the moisture from his face.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000017_000000.wav|2277|"All right, now.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000035_000000.wav|2277|The hours slipped by, and with them the possibility of the union he had contemplated.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000046_000002.wav|2277|He troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000011.wav|2277|He would plead until her anger would melt-until she would forgive him.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000014_000000.wav|2277|"Yes, sir."
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000001.wav|2277|Now he had done it.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000004.wav|2277|He drank more brandy and soda than he had any evening in months.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000000.wav|2277|One of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came back on a Randolph Street car, and without noticing arrived almost opposite the building of the concern with which his son was connected.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000001.wav|2277|What could be the trouble in that quarter?
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000015_000000.wav|2277|"You've seen my wife?" he asked as a precautionary measure as the boy turned to go.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000022_000001.wav|2277|He had evidently delivered the package, for, as he came up, he made no sign of taking anything out of his pocket.

dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000004.wav|2277|He saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000041_000000.wav|2277|Suddenly he thought: "Supposing she isn't out there-suppose she has gone?"
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000052_000002.wav|2277|If he did, he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil.

dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000046_000001.wav|2277|In the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000004.wav|2277|But, oh, the wretchedness of being forced this way!
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000004.wav|2277|Well, well, fortune plays a man queer tricks.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000005.wav|2277|He had loved her earnestly enough, but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000006.wav|2277|She would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000005.wav|2277|He was desperately in love, and would have taken great chances to win her under ordinary circumstances, but now-now what? Supposing she had found out something?
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000027_000000.wav|2277|"Any answer?"
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000023_000000.wav|2277|"Well?" said Hurstwood.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000035_000002.wav|2277|Three o'clock came, four, five, six, and no letter.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000003.wav|2277|He could hardly realise how it had all come about.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000042_000001.wav|2277|It was too much to think of and sit still.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000002.wav|2277|How could things have taken such a violent turn, and so quickly?
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000007.wav|2277|It would be just like this to happen as things were going now. Meanwhile he had not sent the money.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000049_000000.wav|2277|"Very truly yours, etc"
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000000.wav|2277|He strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort, his hands in his pockets, his brow wrinkled, his mouth set.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000005.wav|2277|He was altogether a fine example of great mental perturbation.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000046_000003.wav|2277|He stayed at his desk long after all others had gone, and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000009_000000.wav|2277|For all his study nothing came of the evening except this-he sent the money.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000001.wav|2277|Lord, Lord, he thought, what had he got into?
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000044_000002.wav|2277|He did not go within a block of the house.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000047_000001.wav|2277|It read:
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000006.wav|2277|He really pined for a word, and looked out upon her with his mind's eye in the most wistful manner.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000037_000001.wav|2277|It seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000044_000001.wav|2277|He did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to Carrie, but when he got in Ogden Place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000018_000000.wav|2277|"Any answer?"
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000037_000000.wav|2277|He read it through carefully several times, and then merely shook his head.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000016_000001.wav|2277|I know her."
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000035_000004.wav|2277|It was the worst Sunday he had spent in his life.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000000.wav|2277|When Hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000033_000004.wav|2277|The thought that this letter would probably not reach her until Monday chafed him exceedingly.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000031_000001.wav|2277|No word from Carrie.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000052_000003.wav|2277|He folded the letter and put it with the other one.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000001.wav|2277|He was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar, but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000025_000000.wav|2277|"My wife?"
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000001.wav|2277|This sent a pang through his heart.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000003.wav|2277|His absence did not seem to be noticed by either of his children.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000000.wav|2277|Meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to Carrie.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000038_000000.wav|2277|"Well!" he said after a time, quite audibly, "I don't know."
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000043_000000.wav|2277|Nevertheless, his rousing availed him nothing.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000000.wav|2277|To add to his misery there was no word from Carrie.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000050_000000.wav|2277|"Compromise!" exclaimed Hurstwood bitterly.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000042_000000.wav|2277|He was forced to take his feet.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000033_000005.wav|2277|He must get some speedier method-but how?
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000002.wav|2277|No letter had come, no word of any kind, and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000008.wav|2277|Come what might, he would adjust this matter, and soon.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000031_000000.wav|2277|Next day he went again to the office and opened his mail, suspicious and hopeful of its contents.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000007.wav|2277|He did not propose to lose her, whatever she might think.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000016_000000.wav|2277|"Oh, yes, sir.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000002.wav|2277|There was no use speculating over that.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000033_000003.wav|2277|He decided to write her care of the West Side Post office and ask for an explanation, as well as to have her meet him.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000026_000000.wav|2277|"Yes, sir."
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000004.wav|2277|It seemed a monstrous, unnatural, unwarranted condition which had suddenly descended upon him without his let or hindrance.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000030_000002.wav|2277|He wondered what the morning would bring forth, and slept anything but soundly upon it.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000032_000001.wav|2277|He fancied, as he sat at his desk, that nothing would be done for a week or two.
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000024_000000.wav|2277|"I gave it to her."
dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000022_000000.wav|2277|In about an hour and three quarters the boy returned.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000007_000003.wav|2277|He could arrange that satisfactorily, for Carrie would be glad to wait, if necessary.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000008.wav|2277|He jangled it fiercely several times in succession, but without avail.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000006.wav|2277|He rang again-this time harder.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000002_000005.wav|2277|He walked the floor of his little office, and later that of his room, putting one thing and another together to no avail.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000015_000001.wav|2277|I need it to carry out my plans.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000009_000007.wav|2277|She had not been able to get away this morning.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000004_000003.wav|2277|Curse it!
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000007_000007.wav|2277|How much more pleasant it would be.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000009_000003.wav|2277|Could she have been reached by his wife?
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000012_000001.wav|2277|He looked at the little chap with a feeling of doubt.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000011_000002.wav|2277|He walked the floor again, pretending to be in an ordinary mood, but secretly troubled beyond the expression of words.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000030_000000.wav|2277|So this was the game, was it?
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000009_000000.wav|2277|His spirits fell, however, when, upon reaching the park, he waited and waited and Carrie did not come.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000008.wav|2277|He would go up there and have it out with her, that's what he would do.

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000002_000002.wav|2277|While he was not sure how much significance might be attached to the threat she had made, he was sure that her attitude, if long continued, would cause him no end of trouble.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000019_000000.wav|2277|He arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000007_000006.wav|2277|He saw only her pretty face and neat figure and wondered why life was not arranged so that such joy as he found with her could be steadily maintained.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000002_000003.wav|2277|She was determined, and had worsted him in a very important contest.

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000024_000000.wav|2277|He began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other-that he had sent the money.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000010_000000.wav|2277|After a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the Madison car. To add to his distress, the bright blue sky became overcast with little fleecy clouds which shut out the sun
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000017_000000.wav|2277|Later, however, his old discretion asserted itself.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000004_000000.wav|2277|Hurstwood walked the floor, mentally arranging the chief points of his situation.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000010.wav|2277|These were his first thoughts.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000004.wav|2277|Then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing, contemplating the result of his work.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000022_000000.wav|2277|He put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella.

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000002.wav|2277|He pulled out his key and tried to insert it, but another key was on the inside.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000002_000001.wav|2277|He was in a fevered state of mind, owing to the blight his wife's action threatened to cast upon his entire future.

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000030_000001.wav|2277|Shut him out and make him pay.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000009.wav|2277|She was carrying things with too high a hand.

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000026_000002.wav|2277|He rang the bell and then waited.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000014_000000.wav|2277|Hurstwood recognised his wife's writing.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000015_000005.wav|2277|So don't delay, but send it by the boy."
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000018_000000.wav|2277|"Damn her!" he said softly, with his teeth firmly set, "I'll make it hot for her if she causes me trouble.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000005_000005.wav|2277|He would have to explain and deny and make a general mark of himself.

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000005_000000.wav|2277|He also thought of his managerial position.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000005_000003.wav|2277|My friends, too!" He grew more angry as he thought of the talk any action on her part would create.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000007_000008.wav|2277|Then he would take up his wife's threat again, and the wrinkles and moisture would return.

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000011_000000.wav|2277|He went in and examined his letters, but there was nothing from Carrie. Fortunately, there was nothing from his wife either.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000024_000001.wav|2277|Perhaps he could do it up here.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000009_000002.wav|2277|Could something have happened out there to keep her away?

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000003_000002.wav|2277|He would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000001.wav|2277|The audacity of the thing took his breath.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000006_000001.wav|2277|He saw no solution of anything-not a loophole left.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000013_000000.wav|2277|"I'm to bring an answer," said the boy.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000003.wav|2277|His first impulse was to write but four words in reply-"Go to the devil!"--but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000003_000001.wav|2277|Now that she had practically cowed him, she would follow up her work with demands, the acknowledgment of which would make her word law in the future.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000003.wav|2277|He shook at the knob, but the door was locked.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000029_000000.wav|2277|Hurstwood looked, but there was no face there now.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000011_000001.wav|2277|He thanked his stars that he did not have to confront that proposition just now when he needed to think so much.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000001.wav|2277|He alighted and went up the steps to the front door, but it was with a nervous palpitation of the heart.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000021_000001.wav|2277|He'd take it to her-he would go up there and have a talk with her, and that at once.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000014_000001.wav|2277|He tore it open and read without a show of feeling.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000008_000004.wav|2277|If he could only get plenty of time to think, perhaps something would turn up.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000026_000003.wav|2277|Finally, seeing that no one was coming, he turned and went back to his cab.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000005.wav|2277|What would she do about that?
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000024_000003.wav|2277|He would have no row.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000023_000001.wav|2277|On the way his temper cooled as he thought of the details of the case.

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000002.wav|2277|It roused his ire also-the deepest element of revolt in him.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000019_000006.wav|2277|He scarcely noticed the picture.

dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000007_000002.wav|2277|It was the one pleasing thing in this whole rout of trouble.
dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000006_000000.wav|2277|Many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this, and his brow moistened.

dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000048_000000.wav|251|"The center of the quake was right under Faber Electronics," Tom remarked.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000009_000001.wav|251|The walls and roof were shuddering and creaking, and the concrete floor was heaving under their feet.

dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000054_000001.wav|251|Phyl, a pretty, dark haired girl, was the daughter of mr Swift's long-time friend and business associate, "Uncle Ned" Newton.

dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000037_000001.wav|251|"There would've been a lot more casualties."
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000019_000000.wav|251|"Good night!" Tom's eyes focused in horror on the wreckage enveloped by still billowing dust.

dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000032_000001.wav|251|"We'd better not try to move him," Tom decided.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000042_000001.wav|251|"Why not send a car?

dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000044_000001.wav|251|"Anyhow, we want to help.

dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000055_000000.wav|251|Tom laughed.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000064_000000.wav|251|Both boys were amazed and excited.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000062_000000.wav|251|"A visitor?" Tom looked at his father.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000044_000002.wav|251|Got a job for us?"
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000021_000000.wav|251|Suddenly Tom stiffened in fear.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000012_000002.wav|251|Before he reached it, another shock knocked all of them off their feet.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000028_000001.wav|251|He had heard about the great San Francisco earthquake from his grandfather, and had no doubt about the nature of the tremors.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000059_000000.wav|251|After the two boys had showered and changed their clothes, mrs Swift served them a delicious, hot meal.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000022_000000.wav|251|Disregarding his own injuries, Tom hastily freed himself from the debris and groped his way to Bud's side.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000033_000002.wav|251|Then Tom taped a bandage on Bud's scalp wound.

dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000049_000002.wav|251|Tom asked the operator to send a helicopter immediately to pick them up.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000024_000003.wav|251|What hit me?"
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000023_000000.wav|251|"Are you all right?" Tom asked fearfully.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000002_000001.wav|251|"Hope you can find out what's wrong."
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000008_000000.wav|251|"Good grief!" Bud exclaimed.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000056_000002.wav|251|"I was all set for Sandy's cool soothing touch on my fevered brow!"
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000035_000000.wav|251|"Right!" Bud responded.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000055_000002.wav|251|"Why, one of the ambulance doctors checked us out."
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000022_000001.wav|251|With a desperate heave, he shoved the beam away, then cradled Bud's head in his arm.
dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000005_000001.wav|251|Inside, a secret rocket telemetering device was mounted on its test stand.
