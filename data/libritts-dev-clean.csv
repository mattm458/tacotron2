6|dev-clean/1993/147964/1993_147964_000008_000000.wav|1993|I can see them now, exactly as they looked, working about the table in the lamplight: Jake with his heavy features, so rudely moulded that his face seemed, somehow, unfinished; Otto with his half ear and the savage scar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted mustache.
7|dev-clean/1993/147964/1993_147964_000005_000004.wav|1993|We bound it between pasteboards, which I covered with brilliant calico, representing scenes from a circus.
8|dev-clean/1993/147964/1993_147964_000006_000000.wav|1993|On the day before Christmas, Jake packed the things we were sending to the Shimerdas in his saddle bags and set off on grandfather's gray gelding. When he mounted his horse at the door, I saw that he had a hatchet slung to his belt, and he gave grandmother a meaning look which told me he was planning a surprise for me.

14|dev-clean/1993/147964/1993_147964_000006_000003.wav|1993|I put on my cap and ran out to meet Jake.

17|dev-clean/1993/147964/1993_147964_000008_000001.wav|1993|As I remember them, what unprotected faces they were; their very roughness and violence made them defenseless.

19|dev-clean/1993/147964/1993_147964_000007_000009.wav|1993|Our tree became the talking tree of the fairy tale; legends and stories nestled like birds in its branches.

27|dev-clean/1993/147964/1993_147964_000003_000001.wav|1993|The flakes came down so thickly that from the sitting room windows I could not see beyond the windmill-its frame looked dim and gray, unsubstantial like a shadow.
28|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000054_000004.wav|1993|I think I cannot go right, for I either check myself till I'm downright cross to him, or else I speak just natural, and that's too kind and tender by half.
29|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000054_000006.wav|1993|Well, when I'm mrs Harry Carson, may happen I can put some good fortune in Jem's way.

37|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000047_000001.wav|1993|But as he turned to catch a look at her sweet face, he saw that it expressed unfeigned distress, almost amounting to vexation; a dread of him, that he thought was almost repugnance.
38|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000007_000001.wav|1993|They were like many a pair of twins, and seemed to have but one life divided between them.

42|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000037_000000.wav|1993|"Dead!"
43|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000006_000002.wav|1993|Her plan of living was so far arranged, when she heard, with keen sorrow, that Wilson's twin lads were ill of the fever.
44|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000053_000000.wav|1993|Mary lay down on her bed in her clothes; and whether it was this, or the broad daylight that poured in through the sky window, or whether it was over excitement, it was long before she could catch a wink of sleep.
45|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000036_000000.wav|1993|"They're both gone," said she.

47|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000034_000004.wav|1993|He had stolen out during the half hour allowed at the works for tea, to buy them an orange or two, which now puffed out his jacket pocket.
48|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000057_000006.wav|1993|How she would surround him with every comfort she could devise (of course, he was to live with them), till he should acknowledge riches to be very pleasant things, and bless his lady daughter!

50|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000025_000000.wav|1993|She bent down, and fondly, oh! with what passionate fondness, kissed her child, and then gave him up to Alice, who took him with tender care.
51|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000054_000005.wav|1993|And I'm as good as engaged to be married to another; and another far handsomer than Jem; only I think I like Jem's face best for all that; liking's liking, and there's no help for it.
52|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000041_000003.wav|1993|They cried afresh in company.
53|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000009_000000.wav|1993|But when the twins, after ailing many days, and caring little for their meat, fell sick on the same afternoon, with the same heavy stupor of suffering, the three hearts that loved them so, each felt, though none acknowledged to the other, that they had little chance for life.
54|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000041_000000.wav|1993|Jem went to the cupboard, and quietly extricated from his pocket the oranges he had bought.

56|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000016_000002.wav|1993|But earnest as the father was in watching the yet living, he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead, and sprang gently up, and took his dead son on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength, and carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him.
57|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000050_000000.wav|1993|Partly to relieve her from his presence, and partly from natural desire, and partly, perhaps, from a penitent wish to share to the utmost his parents' sorrow, he soon went up stairs to the chamber of death.
58|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000034_000002.wav|1993|But just now he hardly saw her; he went straight up to Alice, and asked how the little chaps were.
59|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000051_000002.wav|1993|So leaving kind messages to George and Jane Wilson, and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to Jem, and deciding that she had better not, she stepped out into the bright morning light, so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been.
60|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000041_000004.wav|1993|Mary's heart melted within her as she witnessed Jem's sorrow, and she stepped gently up to the corner where he stood, with his back turned to them, and putting her hand softly on his arm, said,
61|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000005_000003.wav|1993|So food for four mouths was all she was now required to find; only for three she would have said; for herself and the unweaned child were but reckoned as one in her calculation.
62|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000053_000001.wav|1993|Her thoughts ran on Jem's manner and words; not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day; but still she wished he had not put it so plainly.
63|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000022_000002.wav|1993|Alice and Mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child, whose struggles seemed to increase, till at last his mother said with a choking voice,
64|dev-clean/1993/147149/1993_147149_000038_000001.wav|1993|They took worse about two o'clock.

66|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000007_000001.wav|1993|He stood in the little entry hall, the lantern and his fur cap under his arm, shaking hands with us.
67|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000006_000003.wav|1993|When his deep seeing eyes rested on me, I felt as if he were looking far ahead into the future for me, down the road I would have to travel.
68|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000001_000003.wav|1993|He read the chapters from saint Matthew about the birth of Christ, and as we listened it all seemed like something that had happened lately, and near at hand.
69|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000007_000000.wav|1993|At nine o'clock mr Shimerda lighted one of our lanterns and put on his overcoat and fur collar.
70|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000007_000004.wav|1993|"The prayers of all good people are good," he said quietly.
71|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000005_000001.wav|1993|When the candle ends sent up their conical yellow flames, all the colored figures from Austria stood out clear and full of meaning against the green boughs.
72|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000003_000000.wav|1993|At about four o'clock a visitor appeared: mr Shimerda, wearing his rabbit skin cap and collar, and new mittens his wife had knitted.
73|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000007_000003.wav|1993|As we turned back to the sitting room, grandfather looked at me searchingly.
74|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000003_000005.wav|1993|He sat still and passive, his head resting against the back of the wooden rocking chair, his hands relaxed upon the arms.
75|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000002_000004.wav|1993|He always wrote to her on Christmas Day, he said, no matter where he was, and no matter how long it had been since his last letter.
76|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000003_000004.wav|1993|I suppose, in the crowded clutter of their cave, the old man had come to believe that peace and order had vanished from the earth, or existed only in the old world he had left so far behind.
77|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000001_000005.wav|1993|He gave thanks for our food and comfort, and prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities, where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us.
78|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000001_000006.wav|1993|Grandfather's prayers were often very interesting.

80|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000001_000009.wav|1993|His prayers reflected what he was thinking about at the time, and it was chiefly through them that we got to know his feelings and his views about things.
81|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000001_000008.wav|1993|Because he talked so little, his words had a peculiar force; they were not worn dull from constant use.
82|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000001_000002.wav|1993|Morning prayers were longer than usual.
83|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000002_000000.wav|1993|After we sat down to our waffles and sausage, Jake told us how pleased the Shimerdas had been with their presents; even Ambrosch was friendly and went to the creek with him to cut the Christmas tree.
84|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000001_000001.wav|1993|Jake and Otto shouted "Merry Christmas"! to me, and winked at each other when they saw the waffle irons on the stove. Grandfather came down, wearing a white shirt and his Sunday coat.
85|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000001_000004.wav|1993|In his prayer he thanked the Lord for the first Christmas, and for all that it had meant to the world ever since.
86|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000003_000001.wav|1993|He had come to thank us for the presents, and for all grandmother's kindness to his family.
87|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000003_000007.wav|1993|Grandmother insisted on his drinking a glass of Virginia apple brandy after his long walk in the cold, and when a faint flush came up in his cheeks, his features might have been cut out of a shell, they were so transparent.
88|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000003_000008.wav|1993|He said almost nothing, and smiled rarely; but as he rested there we all had a sense of his utter content.
89|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000006_000002.wav|1993|As we sat down to the table, it occurred to me that he liked to look at us, and that our faces were open books to him.
90|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000005_000003.wav|1993|His long body formed a letter "S." I saw grandmother look apprehensively at grandfather. He was rather narrow in religious matters, and sometimes spoke out and hurt people's feelings.
91|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000003_000006.wav|1993|His face had a look of weariness and pleasure, like that of sick people when they feel relief from pain.
92|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000002_000001.wav|1993|It was a soft gray day outside, with heavy clouds working across the sky, and occasional squalls of snow.
93|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000002_000005.wav|1993|All afternoon he sat in the dining room.
94|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000001_000007.wav|1993|He had the gift of simple and moving expression.
95|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000003_000003.wav|1993|This feeling seemed completely to take possession of mr Shimerda.
96|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000006_000000.wav|1993|We persuaded our guest to stay for supper with us.
97|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000002_000003.wav|1993|Then Jake and I played dominoes, while Otto wrote a long letter home to his mother.
98|dev-clean/1993/147965/1993_147965_000006_000001.wav|1993|He needed little urging.

520|dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000023_000000.wav|174|The early days passed in this dazzled state.
521|dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000036_000000.wav|174|It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, all cracked with chilblains, and kissed it.
522|dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000033_000000.wav|174|It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the principal lodger, and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, who had let him the lodging on Christmas eve.
523|dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000024_000000.wav|174|Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another being, poor little thing!
524|dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000040_000000.wav|174|To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearly the whole of Jean Valjean's existence.
525|dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000016_000000.wav|174|Some new thing had come into his soul.

528|dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000029_000000.wav|174|And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the depths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality.
529|dev-clean/174/168635/174_168635_000030_000000.wav|174|Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well.

767|dev-clean/8842/302201/8842_302201_000014_000007.wav|8842|In the third, I say what it is I purpose to speak so as not to be impeded by faintheartedness.

769|dev-clean/8842/302201/8842_302201_000006_000002.wav|8842|And for that the occasion of what I then wrote may be found pleasant in the hearing, I will relate it as briefly as I may.

781|dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000020_000002.wav|8842|The third tells how, after he had in such wise been with me a space, I saw and heard certain things.

783|dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000002_000005.wav|8842|Then my heart that was so full of love said unto me: "It is true that our lady lieth dead;" and it seemed to me that I went to look upon the body wherein that blessed and most noble spirit had had its abiding place.
784|dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000020_000001.wav|8842|The second says how it appeared to me that Love spake within my heart, and what was his aspect.

786|dev-clean/8842/302203/8842_302203_000011_000002.wav|8842|In the second, I say how I told them.

He mentioned the name of one of the old servants at Mount Morven, who had attached himself to Randal after the breakup of the family.
823|dev-clean/8297/275154/8297_275154_000003_000001.wav|8297|Captain Bennydeck had landed, to all appearance in fairly good health; and had left by an early train for London.

865|dev-clean/8297/275154/8297_275154_000008_000004.wav|8297|And yet he spoke roughly; he looked like an angry man brought to bay.

923|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000024_000000.wav|8297|He added Sydney's address in a postscript, and dispatched his letter that evening.
924|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000002_000001.wav|8297|Suspicion overclouded his face as he put the question.
925|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000003_000000.wav|8297|Randal could deny that he had seen Catherine, with perfect truth-and did deny it in the plainest terms.
926|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000015_000001.wav|8297|When will you ask her to let me see Kitty?"

929|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000013_000001.wav|8297|"If Catherine does think of marrying again," he said, "the man will have to reckon first with me. But that is not the point.
930|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000009_000002.wav|8297|If it had driven me out of mind, I shouldn't have been surprised."

932|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000013_000006.wav|8297|Have you seen Catherine lately?"
933|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000021_000002.wav|8297|It was for the Captain to confirm what mrs Presty had said of him, if he thought it desirable to touch on the subject in his reply.
934|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000000.wav|8297|The serious embarrassments that surrounded him were thickening fast.

936|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000021_000001.wav|8297|Considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty, even with an intimate friend.
937|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000008_000000.wav|8297|Not satisfied with gossip in private, the greedy public appetite devours gossip in print, and wants more of it than any one editor can supply. Randal picked up the torn newspaper.
938|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000007_000001.wav|8297|"Malcolm meant well, poor fellow," he said, referring to the old servant, "but he made a miserable man of me for all that."
939|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000003_000001.wav|8297|Herbert was satisfied.

941|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000020_000000.wav|8297|Even this apparently simple proceeding required examination in its different bearings, before he could begin his letter.
942|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000018_000000.wav|8297|If Randal shrank from the prospect which thus presented itself to him, in his relations with his brother, and if his thoughts reverted to Sydney Westerfield, other reasons for apprehension found their way into his mind.
943|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000006_000001.wav|8297|"Do you know, Randal, I was almost afraid that Catherine was the woman.

947|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000004.wav|8297|Add to this, that his confidence in Catherine had been rudely shaken.
948|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000013_000000.wav|8297|Herbert became more unreasonable than ever.

950|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000013_000003.wav|8297|The bare doubt that my divorced wife might be the woman was bad enough-but what I wanted to find out was how she had passed off her false pretense on our child.
951|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000006_000000.wav|8297|"She's not Catherine, at any rate; I, for one, shall go home with a lighter heart." He took his brother's arm, to return to the other platform.
952|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000009.wav|8297|In the meantime, after what mrs Presty had confessed, the cruel falsehood which had checked poor Kitty's natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and child.
953|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000019_000001.wav|8297|To perform that promise appeared to be now simply impossible.

955|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000001_000000.wav|8297|For a moment the two men looked at each other without speaking. Herbert's wondering eyes accurately reflected his brother's astonishment.
956|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000021_000000.wav|8297|Would he be justified in alluding to the report which associated Bennydeck with Catherine?
957|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000008_000002.wav|8297|Herbert had been reading a rival journal, devoted to the interests of Society-in which the report of mrs Norman's marriage was repeated, with this difference, that it boldly alluded to Captain Bennydeck by name.
958|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000010_000001.wav|8297|Supposing the report had been true-?"
959|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000002.wav|8297|If he followed his inclinations, in the near neighborhood of the hotel, who could say what disasters might not ensue, in his brother's present frame of mind?
960|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000003.wav|8297|If he made the disclosure on their return to the house, he would be only running the same risk of consequences, after an interval of delay; and, if he remained silent, the march of events might, at any moment, lead to the discovery of what he had concealed.
961|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000014_000000.wav|8297|"Not lately."
962|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000005.wav|8297|Having allowed herself to be entrapped into the deception proposed by her mother, and having thus far persevered in that deception, were the chances in favor of her revealing her true position-especially if she was disposed to encourage Bennydeck's suit?
963|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000013_000002.wav|8297|You seem to have forgotten that the woman at Buck's Hotel is described as a Widow.
964|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000019_000005.wav|8297|But that she would receive the same unremitting attention, while he was courting Catherine, which would have been offered to her under other circumstances, was not to be hoped.
965|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000005_000000.wav|8297|"no"
966|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000007.wav|8297|In any event, her second marriage would lead to one disastrous result.

968|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000021_000003.wav|8297|Besides, looking to Catherine's interest-and not forgetting how she had suffered-had Randal any right to regard with other than friendly feelings a second marriage, which united her to a man morally and intellectually the superior of her first husband?
969|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000023_000003.wav|8297|Shall I say that she may expect an early visit from you, when I see her to morrow?
970|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000002_000000.wav|8297|"What are you doing here?" he asked.
971|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000027_000003.wav|8297|But it might, perhaps, be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on, and that the Captain's proposals were still waiting for Catherine's reply.
972|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000019_000007.wav|8297|He decided on hastening Sydney's introduction to Bennydeck, and on writing at once to prepare the Captain for that event.
973|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000026_000000.wav|8297|The first which he happened to take up was addressed to him in mrs Presty's handwriting.
974|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000017_000001.wav|8297|His natural frank nature urged him to undeceive Herbert.
975|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000016_000000.wav|8297|"Leave that to me," was the one reply which Randal could venture to make at the moment.
976|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000019_000002.wav|8297|Under the exasperating influence of a disappointment for which she was not prepared, it was hard to say what act of imprudence Sydney might not commit.
977|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000007_000000.wav|8297|He snatched a newspaper out of his pocket as he spoke-tore it in half-and threw it away.
978|dev-clean/8297/275156/8297_275156_000013_000005.wav|8297|No more of it now.

980|dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000006_000004.wav|8297|With his own suspicions steadily contradicting him, he arrived at the hotel, obstinately believing that "the charming widow" would prove to be a stranger.
981|dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000013_000000.wav|8297|"I am indeed sorry to spoil your dramatic effect," she said.
982|dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000036_000000.wav|8297|"That will do, mrs Presty.

984|dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000025_000000.wav|8297|"I should have told the truth."

986|dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000003_000003.wav|8297|As he took his place in the carriage, the newspaper boy appeared at the window as usual.
987|dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000009_000000.wav|8297|"It depends on you to decide that," Randal replied.
988|dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000008_000003.wav|8297|Her keen penetration discovered something in his face which checked the gayety of her welcome.
989|dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000047_000000.wav|8297|Arrived at the station, Randal found that he must wait for the train. While he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about Sydney, the train from London came in.

991|dev-clean/8297/275155/8297_275155_000039_000003.wav|8297|Have you any message for Captain Bennydeck?"

1137|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000035_000001.wav|6241|The town lies on a flat and marshy plain, between two hills.
1138|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000010_000001.wav|6241|The fact is, the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of Denmark.
1139|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000018_000003.wav|6241|After some hours we came in sight of a solitary rock in the ocean, forming a mighty vault, through which the foaming waves poured with intense fury.
1140|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000004_000000.wav|6241|The hour of departure came at last.
1141|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000038_000004.wav|6241|I have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out, to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation.
1142|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000029_000001.wav|6241|Here we are in Iceland.
1143|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000009_000001.wav|6241|You might perhaps even follow us to the centre of the earth, there to resolve your eternal doubts."
1144|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000011_000000.wav|6241|The castle of Kronborg soon disappeared in the murky atmosphere, as well as the tower of Helsinborg, which raises its head on the Swedish Bank. And here the schooner began to feel in earnest the breezes of the Kattegat.
1145|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000017_000000.wav|6241|The voyage offered no incident worthy of record.
1146|dev-clean/6241/61943/6241_61943_000032_000000.wav|6241|"In the meanwhile," I replied, "I will take a walk through the town. Will you not likewise do so?"
1147|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000033_000001.wav|6241|The sweeping and broken waves came rolling in upon the pointed rocks; the gulf was surrounded by rocky walls-a mighty cliff, three thousand feet in height, remarkable for its brown strata, separated here and there by beds of tufa of a reddish hue.
1148|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000005_000002.wav|6241|It was, in fact, real tourist weather.
1149|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000005_000001.wav|6241|We had neither to fear fatiguing heat nor drenching rain.

1151|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000018_000001.wav|6241|Look at Hans.
1152|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000009_000000.wav|6241|There could be no doubt that this was all this terrible Saknussemm had done.
1153|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000030_000000.wav|6241|Three hours later, still traveling over those apparently interminable and sandy prairies, we were compelled to go round the Kollafjord, an easier and shorter cut than crossing the gulfs.
1154|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000044_000000.wav|6241|"What does he say?" I asked, considerably puzzled by the delay and the dialogue.
1155|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000016_000005.wav|6241|We must not, however, attempt to hurry him; we must allow him to have his own way, and I will undertake to say that between us we shall do our ten leagues a day."
1156|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000019_000003.wav|6241|In this country there are no roads, paths are nearly unknown, and vegetation, poor as it was, slowly as it reached perfection, soon obliterated all traces of the few travelers who passed from place to place.
1157|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000007_000000.wav|6241|I began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling, a life of desire, gratification and liberty.
1158|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000017_000000.wav|6241|"We may do so," was my reply, "but what about our worthy guide?"

1162|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000010_000000.wav|6241|It was just before we left Reykjavik that I came to this decision.
1163|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000011_000001.wav|6241|Our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord, without requiring whip or spur.
1164|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000030_000002.wav|6241|These sacred edifices are, however, very much like these people, who do without watches-and never miss them.
1165|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000027_000001.wav|6241|I pointed this out to my uncle, who made a very energetic grimace.
1166|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000029_000000.wav|6241|He was about to make some energetic observation to the guide, but Hans, without taking the slightest notice of him, went in front of the horses, and walked ahead with the same imperturbable phlegm he had always exhibited.
1167|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000014_000000.wav|6241|The rugged summits of the rocky hills were dimly visible on the edge of the horizon, through the misty fogs; every now and then some heavy flakes of snow showed conspicuous in the morning light, while certain lofty and pointed rocks were first lost in the grey low clouds, their summits clearly visible above, like jagged reefs rising from a troublous sea.
1168|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000022_000002.wav|6241|In reality, the great volcanic movement of the island, and all its attendant phenomena, are concentrated in the interior of the island; there, horizontal layers or strata of rocks, piled one upon the other, eruptions of basaltic origin, and streams of lava, have given this country a kind of supernatural reputation.
1169|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000043_000000.wav|6241|"Tidvatten," said the guide.
1170|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000019_000001.wav|6241|The country we had reached was already nearly a desert.

1172|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000013_000000.wav|6241|Hans, on taking his departure from Reykjavik, had followed the line of the sea.
1173|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000046_000000.wav|6241|"Of course I understand-we must wait till the tide serves."
1174|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000050_000000.wav|6241|I thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting, before crossing the fjord, for that moment when the sea at its highest point is in a state of slack water.
1175|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000049_000000.wav|6241|My uncle frowned, stamped his feet and then followed the horses to where the boat lay.
1176|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000022_000000.wav|6241|We were to learn this all in good time.
1177|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000051_000000.wav|6241|The favorable moment did not come until six o'clock in the evening.
1178|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000005_000000.wav|6241|The weather was overcast but settled, when we commenced our adventurous and perilous journey.
1179|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000034_000000.wav|6241|"If they are really intelligent," I said to myself, "they will certainly not make the attempt.
1180|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000045_000000.wav|6241|"He says tide," replied my uncle, translating the Danish word for my information.
1181|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000015_000001.wav|6241|Our horses, however, appeared not only well acquainted with the country, but by a kind of instinct, knew which was the best road.
1182|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000016_000000.wav|6241|"Good beast, good beast," he would cry.
1183|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000025_000001.wav|6241|He shared our frugal breakfast, answered Yes, and No to my uncle's questions as to the nature of the road, and at last when asked where we were to pass the night was as laconic as usual.
1184|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000007_000001.wav|6241|The truth is, that my spirits rose so rapidly, that I began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be a terrible journey.
1185|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000016_000002.wav|6241|Snow, tempest, impracticable roads, rocks, icebergs-nothing stops him.
1186|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000023_000000.wav|6241|Little did I expect, however, the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of Sneffels, where agglomerations of nature's ruins form a kind of terrible chaos.
1187|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000019_000000.wav|6241|All this while we were advancing at a rapid pace.

1189|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000018_000004.wav|6241|I should have a violent attack of the cramp if I were not to have some sort of exercise.
1190|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000033_000003.wav|6241|To ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd.
1191|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000025_000000.wav|6241|Hans stopped here one half hour.
1192|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000033_000002.wav|6241|Now, whatever may have been the intelligence of our horses, I had not the slightest reliance upon them, as a means of crossing a stormy arm of the sea.
1193|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000020_000001.wav|6241|What, then, must be the state of the less known and more distant parts of the island?
1194|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000011_000002.wav|6241|My uncle and I came behind, cutting a very tolerable figure upon our small but vigorous animals.
1195|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000051_000001.wav|6241|Then my uncle, myself, and guide, two boatmen and the four horses got into a very awkward flat bottom boat.
1196|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000015_000002.wav|6241|My uncle had not even the satisfaction of urging forward his steed by whip, spur, or voice.
1197|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000040_000000.wav|6241|"Der," answered Hans, pointing to where lay the boat in question-"there."
1198|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000018_000005.wav|6241|My arms are right-but my legs are getting a little stiff."
1199|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000042_000000.wav|6241|"Why did you not say so before," cried my uncle; "why not start at once?"
1200|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000021_000001.wav|6241|What, then, must we expect when we come to the upheaved regions-to the districts broken and roughened from volcanic eruptions and subterraneous commotions?
1201|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000018_000003.wav|6241|Besides, if he were to complain of weariness, he could have the loan of my horse.
1202|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000009_000002.wav|6241|All, then, that may be required of me I will do cheerfully, and will create no difficulty.
1203|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000039_000000.wav|6241|"What, a ferry boat!"
1204|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000006_000000.wav|6241|As there was nothing I liked better than horse exercise, the pleasure of riding through an unknown country caused the early part of our enterprise to be particularly agreeable to me.
1205|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000034_000001.wav|6241|In any case, I shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs."
1206|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000011_000000.wav|6241|Hans, our extraordinary guide, went first, walking with a steady, rapid, unvarying step.

1208|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000013_000001.wav|6241|We took our way through poor and sparse meadows, which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green.
1209|dev-clean/6241/61946/6241_61946_000035_000001.wav|6241|He dug his heels into the sides of his steed, and made for the shore.

1219|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000019_000002.wav|3576|He saw that his squires (for so they call those who follow that trade) were about to rifle Sancho Panza, but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed, so the girdle escaped.

1221|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000044_000001.wav|3576|And if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation, come with me, and I will show you how to become a knight errant, a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice."
1222|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000024_000001.wav|3576|Give me my horse and arms, and wait for me here; I will go in quest of this knight, and dead or alive I will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty."
1223|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000019_000003.wav|3576|He wondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shield on the ground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going up to him he said, "Be not so cast down, good man, for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but into Roque Guinart's, which are more merciful than cruel."
1224|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000033_000000.wav|3576|"What are you talking about, man?" said one of the bystanders; "I have got them, and they are not worth three reals."
1225|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000018_000002.wav|3576|Don Quixote did so, and asked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of.
1226|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000051_000000.wav|3576|One of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon and Catalan, "This captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he wants to be so generous another time, let it be with his own property and not ours."
1227|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000048_000000.wav|3576|"So then," said Roque Guinart, "we have got here nine hundred crowns and sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see how much there falls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician." As soon as the robbers heard this they raised a shout of "Long life to Roque Guinart, in spite of the lladres that seek his ruin!"
1228|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000039_000000.wav|3576|At this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads, to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief, came up and said, "Senor, there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to Barcelona."
1229|dev-clean/3576/138058/3576_138058_000037_000000.wav|3576|Upon this Sancho remarked, "From what I have seen here, justice is such a good thing that there is no doing without it, even among the thieves themselves."

1494|dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000018_000005.wav|2428|Mary Ann was silent for some time; then she quietly remarked:

1556|dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000018_000000.wav|2428|The Snellings have an aunt who lives in an out of the way hole at the other end of nowhere.
1557|dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000008_000000.wav|2428|Besides, I was turning things over in my mind.
1558|dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000031_000001.wav|2428|At least I drew up a list of people who ought to meet the occasion, and I tried in more than one instance to drop a hint of what, as I felt, they ought to meet it with.
1559|dev-clean/2428/83705/2428_83705_000015_000004.wav|2428|I did not want any unpleasantness; and I am quite sure there would have been unpleasantness had I demurred.
1560|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000008_000003.wav|2428|It appeared that the terms would be five guineas; but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover.
1561|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000011_000005.wav|2428|Hardly the sort of weather to start for an unknown destination "in the heart of the country." But, at the last moment, I did not like to back out.
1562|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000010_000001.wav|2428|No doubt the five guineas were badly wanted; even a "lively family" would be hardly likely to advertise for a perfect stranger to spend Christmas with them if they were not.
1563|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000043_000001.wav|2428|There be a lot of luggage. He do say he's come to stay with you."
1564|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000009_000003.wav|2428|And yet, from my boyhood upward, I have desired to meet one. Here was an opportunity offered.
1565|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000011_000002.wav|2428|In the morning it began to freeze.
1566|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000029_000003.wav|2428|No answer; though I allowed a more than decent interval.
1567|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000029_000000.wav|2428|There appeared to be no knocker, though whether it had been "twisted" off was more than I could say.
1568|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000003_000000.wav|2428|AN old-fashioned CHRISTMAS.
1569|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000012_000003.wav|2428|I am no dealer in poisons.
1570|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000039_000004.wav|2428|After a few seconds' interval the pit pat of what was obviously one pair of feet came towards the door.
1571|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000013_000001.wav|2428|The youngest member of the family might be twenty, or the oldest ten.
1572|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000027_000002.wav|2428|There was a great shadow, which possibly did duty for a house, but, if so, there was not a light in any of the windows, and there was nothing visible in the shape of a door.
1573|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000039_000002.wav|2428|I had not come all that way, and subjected myself to so much discomfort, to be played tricks with.
1574|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000053_000000.wav|2428|"The mare, she'll stand still enough.
1575|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000008_000001.wav|2428|The reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand.
1576|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000017_000004.wav|2428|Never shall I forget the drive, in that miserable cart, through the storm and those pitch black country lanes.
1577|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000009_000004.wav|2428|She was apparently the careworn mother of a "lively family." Under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be "lively" herself, but her name was Madge, and it was the accident of her Christian name which decided me to go.
1578|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000017_000000.wav|2428|There was a trap at the "Boy and Blunderbuss," but that required fetching.
1579|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000025_000001.wav|2428|Suddenly the cart pulled up.
1580|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000035_000000.wav|2428|"mr Christopher, from London."
1581|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000005.wav|2428|Then I had to wait three quarters of an hour for a train to take me back again, only to find that I had missed the one I intended to catch.
1582|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000011_000004.wav|2428|And it kept on snowing; that turned out to be quite a record in the way of snow storms.
1583|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000043_000000.wav|2428|"I drove him over from the station, Miss.
1584|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000024_000001.wav|2428|I did not ask.
1585|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000042_000000.wav|2428|That was all she said.
1586|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000007_000001.wav|2428|It had its points.
1587|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000042_000001.wav|2428|I looked at her; she at me.
1588|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000007.wav|2428|It is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that I made it warm for the officials, however cold I might have been myself.
1589|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000024_000003.wav|2428|I was chilled to the bone, wet, tired, hungry.
1590|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000011_000003.wav|2428|By the time the streets were like so many skating rinks it commenced to snow.
1591|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000024_000002.wav|2428|I was beyond it.
1592|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000047_000000.wav|2428|"Perhaps you had better come inside."
1593|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000045_000000.wav|2428|"I can't say rightly as how I should, Miss.
1594|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000050_000000.wav|2428|"Have you any luggage?" I admitted that I had.
1595|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000014_000008.wav|2428|No doubt they would set him down as a lunatic right away.
1596|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000026_000000.wav|2428|"Here we be."
1597|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000031_000002.wav|2428|The bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house.
1598|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000012_000001.wav|2428|I had not given a Christmas present for years-there had been no one to give them to.
1599|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000048_000000.wav|2428|"I think I had."
1600|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000021_000000.wav|2428|There was something in the tone of his "Ah!" which whetted my curiosity, near the end of my tether though I was.
1601|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000008_000006.wav|2428|There was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided, nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained, or the table which was kept.
1602|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000010_000004.wav|2428|As for the "pills" and "drops" with which her husband doses himself between the courses, it makes me ill even to think of them.
1603|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000011_000001.wav|2428|All night it had been blowing and raining.
1604|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000014_000006.wav|2428|I would not give him pills.
1605|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000039_000000.wav|2428|Once more I suspected the driver of a chuckle.
1606|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000017_000001.wav|2428|Finally the hulking lad was dispatched.
1607|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000025_000000.wav|2428|We passed through a gate, which I had to get down to open, along some sort of avenue.
1608|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000019_000000.wav|2428|"I am."
1609|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000013_000000.wav|2428|I knew nothing of the people I was going to.
1610|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000039_000007.wav|2428|After a vast amount of unfastening, the door was opened, and on the threshold there stood a girl, with a lighted candle in her hand.
1611|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000000.wav|2428|It was a horrible journey.
1612|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000007_000000.wav|2428|That was the advertisement.
1613|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000040_000001.wav|2428|I'm expected.
1614|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000027_000003.wav|2428|The whereabouts of this, however, the driver presently made clear.
1615|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000007_000005.wav|2428|She and her husband, who suffers from melancholia, and all the other complaints which flesh is heir to, and I, dragging through what I call a patent medicine dinner, and talking of everybody who is dead and gone, or else going, and of nothing else.
1616|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000008_000007.wav|2428|No references were offered or asked for.
1617|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000010_000003.wav|2428|Still I felt that it could hardly be worse than a chop or cousin Lucy; the subjects of her conversation I never cared about when they were alive, and I certainly do not want to talk about them now they are dead.
1618|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000009_000000.wav|2428|Now it is a remarkable thing that I have always had an extraordinary predilection for the name Madge.
1619|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000018_000000.wav|2428|"Be you going to stop with they Wilsons?"
1620|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000034_000000.wav|2428|I sounded another peal.
1621|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000014_000002.wav|2428|I even bought something for Madge-I mean mrs Wilson.
1622|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000050_000001.wav|2428|"Perhaps it had better be brought in."
1623|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000014_000003.wav|2428|Of course, I knew that I had no right to do anything of the kind, and was aware that the chances were a hundred to one against my ever presuming to hint at its existence.
1624|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000042_000002.wav|2428|The driver's voice came from the background.
1625|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000028_000002.wav|2428|If they have, there's a bell on your right, if it isn't broken."
1626|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000039_000008.wav|2428|The storm rushed in; she put up her hand to shield the light from danger.
1627|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000003.wav|2428|He was impervious to reason.
1628|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000001.wav|2428|The trains were late, and, of course, overcrowded; there was enough luggage in our compartment to have filled it, and still there was one more passenger than there ought to have been; an ill conditioned old fellow who wanted my hat box put into the van because it happened to tumble off the rack on to his head.
1629|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000005_000000.wav|2428|THE PROMISE.
1630|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000012_000000.wav|2428|I had been idiot enough to load myself with a lot of Christmas presents, without the faintest notion why.
1631|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000030_000000.wav|2428|"Better ring again," suggested the driver.
1632|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000010_000002.wav|2428|I did not expect a princely entertainment.
1633|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000049_000000.wav|2428|I went inside; it was time.
1634|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000032_000000.wav|2428|"Is there no one in the place?"
1635|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000045_000001.wav|2428|Next time will do.
1636|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000008_000004.wav|2428|I might arrive, it seemed, on Christmas Eve, but there was no hint as to when I was to go, if ever.
1637|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000044_000001.wav|2428|I'm afraid I can offer you nothing to drink.
1638|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000037_000001.wav|2428|Are the people mad?"
1639|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000014_000001.wav|2428|I felt quite lively myself as I mingled with the Christmas crowd, looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous.
1640|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000014_000005.wav|2428|I hoped to goodness that he would not prove to be a hypochondriac, like Lucy's husband.
1641|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000004.wav|2428|His wrangling and jangling so upset me, that I went past the station at which I ought to have changed.
1642|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000022_000000.wav|2428|"Why do you ask?"
1643|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000014_000007.wav|2428|What the "lively family" would think of a perfect stranger arriving burdened with rubbish, as if he had known them all their lives, I did not dare to think.
1644|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000044_000002.wav|2428|We've lost the key of the cellar, and there's nothing out, except water, and I don't think you'd care for that."
1645|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000029_000002.wav|2428|I heard it tinkle in the distance.
1646|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000006.wav|2428|So I had to cool my heels for two hours and a half in a wretched cowshed amidst a bitter, whirling snowstorm.
1647|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000036_000000.wav|2428|The information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter.
1648|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000040_000000.wav|2428|"Can I see mrs Wilson?
1649|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000023_000000.wav|2428|"It be about time as someone were to stay with them as were a bit capable like."
1650|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000038_000000.wav|2428|"Well-thereabouts."
1651|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000027_000000.wav|2428|That might be so.
1652|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000011_000006.wav|2428|I said I would go, and I meant to go.
1653|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000015_000002.wav|2428|I pointed out to him that the rack was specially constructed for light luggage, that a hat box was light luggage, and that if the train jolted, he ought to blame the company, not me.
1654|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000016_000002.wav|2428|When at last I reached Crofton, my journey's end, it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual, who was stationmaster, porter, and clerk combined, and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do.
1655|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000033_000003.wav|2428|If they know you're coming perhaps they hear and don't choose to answer.
1656|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000033_000001.wav|2428|Where's another thing.
1657|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000004_000000.wav|2428|CHAPTER one
1658|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000052_000000.wav|2428|"Do you think that you could manage, Tidy?"
1659|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000039_000003.wav|2428|I tolled the bell again.
1660|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000031_000000.wav|2428|Was there a chuckle in the fellow's voice?
1661|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000039_000005.wav|2428|Again a light gleamed through the pane.
1662|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000008_000005.wav|2428|The whole thing was a trifle odd.
1663|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000016_000001.wav|2428|I counted seven in a distance, I am convinced, of less than twenty miles.
1664|dev-clean/2428/83699/2428_83699_000034_000002.wav|2428|A voice inquired: "Who's there?"

1871|dev-clean/6313/76958/6313_76958_000045_000002.wav|6313|Chunky, however, was too sleepy to see anything so small as a cowman swinging his arms a rod away.
1872|dev-clean/6313/76958/6313_76958_000036_000000.wav|6313|"Keep still, you baby!" growled the cowman.
1873|dev-clean/6313/76958/6313_76958_000071_000000.wav|6313|By the time the cowmen and Pony Riders had refreshed themselves at the spring near which the outfit had camped, a steaming hot breakfast had been spread on the ground, with a slicker for a table cloth.
1874|dev-clean/6313/76958/6313_76958_000076_000000.wav|6313|"Surprisingly well.
1875|dev-clean/6313/76958/6313_76958_000023_000000.wav|6313|"Where are your beds?" asked Stacy after the foreman had urged the boys to get to sleep.
1876|dev-clean/6313/76958/6313_76958_000052_000000.wav|6313|He shook the lad violently.

1878|dev-clean/6313/76958/6313_76958_000069_000000.wav|6313|It was the Chinaman, Pong, sounding his call for breakfast, in accordance with the usage of the plains.

1881|dev-clean/6313/76958/6313_76958_000038_000002.wav|6313|There's the pony ready for you.

1981|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000064_000002.wav|6313|Keep your eyes shut till I tell you to open them."
1982|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000090_000000.wav|6313|The boy could not repress a shudder.
1983|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000073_000000.wav|6313|"All right.
1984|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000046_000000.wav|6313|"And he most certainly will," interrupted Tad, advancing a step.
1985|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000020_000002.wav|6313|"Are you hurt?"
1986|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000011_000002.wav|6313|Walt's alive!
1987|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000025_000002.wav|6313|Hurry!"
1988|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000005_000002.wav|6313|"You'll all be over if you don't have a care.
1989|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000082_000000.wav|6313|"Yes; haul away.
1990|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000062_000001.wav|6313|The movement sent his body swaying giddily from side to side.

1992|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000051_000008.wav|6313|"Here, put my gun in your pocket."
1993|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000003_000000.wav|6313|A moment more and he too caught the plaintive cry for help from below.
1994|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000007_000000.wav|6313|"It's Master Walt," snapped the guide.
1995|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000021_000000.wav|6313|To this question Walter made some reply that was unintelligible to them.
1996|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000044_000002.wav|6313|I'll go down, mr Thomas."
1997|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000012_000000.wav|6313|The shout of joy that had framed itself on the lips of Ned Rector and Stacy Brown died out in an indistinct murmur.
1998|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000051_000004.wav|6313|But, before removing the rope from your own body, make sure that you are safe.
1999|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000038_000001.wav|6313|But talking won't do it.

2002|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000039_000000.wav|6313|"What would you suggest!"
2003|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000013_000000.wav|6313|"Is it possible!
2004|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000083_000001.wav|6313|"Are you all safe down there, Tad?"
2005|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000027_000000.wav|6313|The mountaineer quickly formed a loop in one end of the rope, making it large enough to permit of its slipping over the shoulders of a man.
2006|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000011_000000.wav|6313|"I heard him call.
2007|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000064_000000.wav|6313|"Hold a torch over the edge of the cliff, Master Ned," directed the guide.
2008|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000035_000000.wav|6313|"What do you think has happened to him?" asked Tad in a troubled voice.
2009|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000025_000000.wav|6313|"Yes, that's the only way we can do it.
2010|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000085_000000.wav|6313|Very slowly, restraining their inclination to haul the rope in with all speed only because the warning eyes of the guide were upon them, the two boys, assisted by Professor Zepplin, began hoisting Walter Perkins toward the top.
2011|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000005_000001.wav|6313|Keep back!" he shouted, as the boys and Professor Zepplin began crowding near the masked edge of the cliff.

2016|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000069_000000.wav|6313|"Where is he?"
2017|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000006_000000.wav|6313|"What is it?" demanded the Professor breathlessly.
2018|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000067_000000.wav|6313|"Yes?
2019|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000057_000001.wav|6313|After winding the end tightly about his own arm, he handed a lighted torch to Tad.
2020|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000076_000000.wav|6313|Then followed a long period of suspense.
2021|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000047_000002.wav|6313|You are----"
2022|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000061_000000.wav|6313|"Good!" approved Lige encouragingly, beginning to let the rawhide slip slowly around the trunk of the tree.
2023|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000087_000000.wav|6313|Walter had fully regained consciousness by this time, and a brief examination showed that he had sustained no serious injury, he having struck on the yielding branches of the pinyon, which broke his fall and saved his life.
2024|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000029_000000.wav|6313|There was no response.
2025|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000070_000001.wav|6313|But he doesn't answer me."
2026|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000034_000003.wav|6313|But I don't dare try it.
2027|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000061_000001.wav|6313|As he did so, Tad felt himself gradually sinking into the sombre depths.
2028|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000019_000000.wav|6313|"Yes," agreed Tad, "that does look like bushes.
2029|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000053_000000.wav|6313|"Are you ready?"
2030|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000017_000002.wav|6313|Where is it that you think you see bushes?"
2031|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000023_000001.wav|6313|"It's a tough job.
2032|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000024_000000.wav|6313|"Why not get a rope and let it down to him," suggested Tad.
2033|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000042_000000.wav|6313|"In that case, you will have to go yourself, Thomas," decided the Professor sharply.
2034|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000036_000000.wav|6313|"Fainted, probably.
2035|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000048_000000.wav|6313|"I am needed right here, sir," replied the guide, shortly.
2036|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000068_000000.wav|6313|"I see him," called Tad, his voice sounding hollow and unnatural to those above.
2037|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000054_000000.wav|6313|"Yes."
2038|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000070_000000.wav|6313|"Lodged in the branches of a pinyon tree, I think it is.
2039|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000082_000001.wav|6313|Tell them Walt's all right.
2040|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000052_000000.wav|6313|"I understand."
2041|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000011_000003.wav|6313|But I don't know how we are going to get him."
2042|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000019_000005.wav|6313|Stick tight and don't get scared.
2043|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000025_000001.wav|6313|Run over to the cook tent and tell Jose to give you those rawhide lariats that he will find behind his bunk.
2044|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000032_000001.wav|6313|They gazed at each other in perplexity.
2045|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000084_000000.wav|6313|"Sure thing!" answered the boy.
2046|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000016_000002.wav|6313|Can you make it out?"
2047|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000002_000001.wav|6313|Running to the edge of the cliff, he leaned over and listened intently.
2048|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000045_000001.wav|6313|"It will be better for him to go, if he will----"
2049|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000076_000001.wav|6313|But from the cautious movements of the light far below them, the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability.
2050|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000073_000001.wav|6313|Now try it."
2051|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000044_000001.wav|6313|"I am the one to go after Walt, if anyone has to.
2052|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000071_000000.wav|6313|"Wait a minute," cautioned the mountaineer.
2053|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000043_000000.wav|6313|"Let me go, mr Thomas," interrupted Ned Rector, stepping forward, with almost a challenge in his eyes.
2054|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000005_000000.wav|6313|"Keep back!
2055|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000018_000000.wav|6313|"Over there to the right, just near the edge of the light space made by the torch light," answered the guide.
2056|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000020_000000.wav|6313|"Don't move around.
2057|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000007_000002.wav|6313|Don't move an inch.
2058|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000078_000000.wav|6313|"Keep still!
2059|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000009_000000.wav|6313|"Down there, sir," explained Tad, pointing to the ledge of rock over which Walter had fallen.
2060|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000067_000001.wav|6313|Got him?" he answered, leaning over the cliff.
2061|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000059_000000.wav|6313|"Right!" announced the guide in a reassuring voice.
2062|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000034_000005.wav|6313|I don't dare try any experiments."
2063|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000037_000001.wav|6313|We've got to get Walt up here, even if I have to jump over after him," said Tad firmly.
2064|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000036_000003.wav|6313|Ain't no use to expect him to hook himself onto the line, even if he does wake up," decided the guide with emphasis, beginning to haul up the lariat, which he coiled neatly on the rock in front of him.
2065|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000040_000000.wav|6313|"One of us must go down there," was the guide's startling announcement.
2066|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000045_000000.wav|6313|"Master Tad is right," decided the guide, gazing at the two boys approvingly.
2067|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000019_000002.wav|6313|Hey, Walter!
2068|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000017_000001.wav|6313|All I can see is rocks and shadows.
2069|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000028_000001.wav|6313|Let me know when the rope reaches you.
2070|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000062_000000.wav|6313|He tilted his head to look up.
2071|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000015_000000.wav|6313|"See anything?" asked Tad tremulously, creeping to his side.
2072|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000064_000001.wav|6313|"Better lie down so you, too, don't take a notion to fall off.
2073|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000090_000001.wav|6313|Closing his eyes, he clung to the slender support with grim courage until a hail from above told him that the rawhide loop was rapidly squirming down toward him.
2074|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000013_000001.wav|6313|What are we going to do, Thomas-how are we to rescue the boy?"
2075|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000051_000005.wav|6313|If you find the support too weak to bear your weight, let me know.

2078|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000058_000000.wav|6313|It was a trying moment for all of them, and naturally more so for the boy who was about to descend into the unknown depths of the mountain canyou.
2079|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000001_000000.wav|6313|A DARING RESCUE
2080|dev-clean/6313/66125/6313_66125_000020_000001.wav|6313|Lie perfectly still," warned the guide.

2082|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000093_000000.wav|6313|"Are you hurt?" asked Tad apprehensively.
2083|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000074_000003.wav|6313|"I've seen them do that in the wild west shows too many times not to know how myself."
2084|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000050_000002.wav|6313|The trail is so plainly marked that he can't miss it."

2086|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000062_000001.wav|6313|He slapped Texas sharply on the flank with the flat of his hand.
2087|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000037_000001.wav|6313|"Are there bears up here?"
2088|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000074_000002.wav|6313|I can do that myself," he grunted.
2089|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000043_000000.wav|6313|This announcement filled the boys with excitement.
2090|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000045_000002.wav|6313|We shall need a dog.
2091|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000081_000000.wav|6313|Stacy dismounted and removed the hat carefully to one side.
2092|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000060_000002.wav|6313|It was a beautiful race, the little Indian ponies seeming to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the contest, stretching themselves out to their full lengths, and, with heads on a level with their backs, fairly flew across the great plot of green.
2093|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000065_000001.wav|6313|Even Stacy Brown, though he did not sit his saddle with the same grace that marked the riding of Tad Butler and Ned Rector, more practiced horsemen, was nevertheless no mean rider.

2095|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000038_000003.wav|6313|I came near losing my life too, and----"
2096|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000077_000000.wav|6313|"I will," replied Chunky, confidently.

2099|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000052_000000.wav|6313|An early start was made, so that the party reached the promised table lands shortly before ten o'clock in the forenoon.
2100|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000057_000001.wav|6313|"Suppose we start with a race?
2101|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000029_000000.wav|6313|"Yes."
2102|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000085_000001.wav|6313|You don't have to move the hat, you ninny."
2103|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000045_000000.wav|6313|"That depends.

2105|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000079_000001.wav|6313|Guess I know how to ride.

2110|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000088_000000.wav|6313|"Be careful, Chunky," warned Walter.
2111|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000004_000002.wav|6313|He no doubt would bring food of some kind with him.

2115|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000027_000000.wav|6313|"Now, fall to, young gentlemen," directed the Professor.
2116|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000027_000002.wav|6313|I think I shall help myself to some of that wild plum jam and biscuit, first It reminds me of old times.
2117|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000045_000001.wav|6313|Perhaps Tuesday.
2118|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000051_000000.wav|6313|The boys were now all anxiety to start, while the ponies, after their Sunday rest, were almost as full of life as were their owners.
2119|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000040_000002.wav|6313|Besides this, there are many abandoned mines up the range further.
2120|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000031_000000.wav|6313|Chunky did even better than that.
2121|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000049_000000.wav|6313|The guide said that, by making a detour in their journey that day, they would cross table lands several acres in extent and covered with grass.

2123|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000025_000000.wav|6313|"Yes; wild plum jam," answered the guide.
2124|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000075_000000.wav|6313|Walter smiled, with a twinkle in his eyes.
2125|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000071_000001.wav|6313|Grasping the pommel with the left hand, he appeared to dive head first toward the ground.
2126|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000010_000000.wav|6313|"Had anything to eat!" asked the guide.
2127|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000044_000000.wav|6313|"What I want to know, is, when do we go hunting?" asked Ned.
2128|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000058_000000.wav|6313|To this all agreed.
2129|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000012_000000.wav|6313|"But I left you a rabbit.
2130|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000040_000000.wav|6313|"Yes, the country is full of caves.
2131|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000034_000000.wav|6313|Chunky colored.
2132|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000039_000000.wav|6313|"A cave?" interrupted Tad.
2133|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000047_000000.wav|6313|Supper having been finished, the party gathered about the camp fire for their evening chat, after which, admonishing Stacy to keep within his tent and not to go borrowing trouble, the boys turned in for a sound sleep.
2134|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000091_000000.wav|6313|At the moment when he freed his left foot from the stirrup, he threw his body sharply to the right, reaching for the hat without taking the precaution to grasp the pommel.
2135|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000054_000001.wav|6313|"I guess I had better go along to see that you do not."
2136|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000092_000002.wav|6313|Chunky turned a double somersault, lay still for a moment, then struggled up, rubbing his body gingerly, as the rest of the party came hurrying up to him.
2137|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000065_000000.wav|6313|By this time, the boys had come to feel fully as much at home in the saddle as they formerly had been out of it.
2138|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000042_000000.wav|6313|"All you want.
2139|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000008_000000.wav|6313|"Now you may go," he nodded.
2140|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000076_000000.wav|6313|"Why not show us, then?" he said.
2141|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000052_000001.wav|6313|A temporary camp was quickly pitched.
2142|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000021_000001.wav|6313|Why, mr Thomas, where did you get honey?" asked Walter.
2143|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000033_000000.wav|6313|"Remember, sir, that a certain amount of dignity befits the office of president of the Pony Riders Club," he said.
2144|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000064_000001.wav|6313|All agreed that Tad's superior horsemanship, alone, had won the race for him.
2145|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000028_000000.wav|6313|"Army," added Ned.
2146|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000062_000000.wav|6313|Tad hitched in his saddle a little, throwing the greater part of his weight on the stirrups.
2147|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000011_000001.wav|6313|"Cold water is the most nourishing thing we've touched since last night."
2148|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000032_000000.wav|6313|Ned fixed him with a stern eye.
2149|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000078_000001.wav|6313|"If you haven't I would advise you to go easy.
2150|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000057_000003.wav|6313|We'll do it three times, and the one who wins two times out of three will be it."
2151|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000060_000000.wav|6313|The next two heats were different.
2152|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000035_000000.wav|6313|"It's good, anyway."
2153|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000031_000001.wav|6313|He buried his biscuit under a layer of jam, over which he spread a thick coating of honey.
2154|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000068_000000.wav|6313|"I'll show you," promised Tad.
2155|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000064_000002.wav|6313|Ned took his defeat good naturedly.
2156|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000009_000000.wav|6313|With a shout, the boys dashed pell mell to meet the pack train, and, falling in behind the slow moving burros, urged them on with derisive shouts and sundry resounding slaps on the animals' flanks.
2157|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000051_000001.wav|6313|The little animals were becoming more sure footed every day, and Ned said that, before the trip was finished, "Jimmie" would be able to walk a slack rope.
2158|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000012_000001.wav|6313|Didn't you find it?"
2159|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000021_000000.wav|6313|"Honey?
2160|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000083_000001.wav|6313|I couldn't get it," explained Chunky.
2161|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000020_000000.wav|6313|"Hooray, fellows!" he shouted.
2162|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000071_000000.wav|6313|All at once he dropped to the saddle and slipped the left foot from the stirrup.
2163|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000090_000000.wav|6313|Then Chunky essayed the feat.
2164|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000045_000004.wav|6313|Of course, dogs can't follow the trail of an animal as well, now, as they could with snow on the ground.
2165|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000004_000003.wav|6313|The fire would be ready and thus no time would be lost in preparing the first meal of the day, which, in this case, would be breakfast, dinner and supper all in one.
2166|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000022_000000.wav|6313|"Found a bee tree on my way back, and cut it down.
2167|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000089_000000.wav|6313|"He's got to learn," declared Tad.
2168|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000053_000000.wav|6313|At their urgent request, Professor Zepplin told the boys to go ahead and enjoy themselves.
2169|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000059_000001.wav|6313|Walter Perkins won the heat.
2170|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000078_000000.wav|6313|"Got your life insured?" asked Ned.
2171|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000018_000000.wav|6313|By the time the meal was ready the tents had been pitched and the boys had returned from the spring, rubbing their faces with their coarse towels, their cheeks glowing and their eyes sparkling in anticipation of the feast.
2172|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000063_000000.wav|6313|Texas seemed to leap clear of the ground, planting himself on all fours just over the line, the winner by a neck.
2173|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000023_000000.wav|6313|"We'll take all chances," advised Ned.
2174|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000023_000002.wav|6313|It looks like jam."
2175|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000020_000002.wav|6313|What do you think of that?"
2176|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000085_000000.wav|6313|"Why don't you move the pony?
2177|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000045_000003.wav|6313|But I know an old settler who will lend us his dog, if it is not out.
2178|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000092_000001.wav|6313|Fortunately, his right foot freed itself from the stirrup at the same time, or there might have been a different ending.
2179|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000036_000002.wav|6313|I offer you my humble apologies.
2180|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000007_000000.wav|6313|It was a gladsome sound to this band of hungry boys, whose ordinarily healthy appetites, under the bracing mountain air and the long fast, had taken on what the Professor described as a "razor edge."
2181|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000061_000000.wav|6313|Up to within a moment of the finish of the second heat the two ponies were racing neck and neck.
2182|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000019_000000.wav|6313|Chunky reached the table first, greedily surveying what had been placed on it.
2183|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000005_000000.wav|6313|The boys awaited the guide's approach with impatience, some pacing back and forth, while others coaxed the fire into a roaring blaze, at the same time confiding to each other how hungry they were.
2184|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000038_000001.wav|6313|"We are in the bear country now.
2185|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000045_000005.wav|6313|But this dog, you will find, is a wonder.

2187|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000060_000001.wav|6313|This time the battle lay between Tad Butler and Ned Rector.
2188|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000092_000000.wav|6313|As a result, instead of stopping when he reached the hat, the boy kept on going.
2189|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000056_000000.wav|6313|The great, green field, surrounded on all sides by tall trees, made the place an ideal one for their purpose.
2190|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000074_000001.wav|6313|That's nothing.
2191|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000036_000000.wav|6313|"Then, I think I'll try some myself," announced Ned, helping himself liberally to the honey and jam.
2192|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000038_000000.wav|6313|"I reckon there are," smiled the guide.
2193|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000016_000002.wav|6313|A stout club for mine."

2201|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000079_000002.wav|6313|Let me have that hat, Tad," he demanded as the latter came trotting up to the group.
2202|dev-clean/6313/66129/6313_66129_000013_000001.wav|6313|It must have come to life some time during the night and dug its way out," laughed Tad.

2408|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000008_000000.wav|3752|mr North sighed again.
2409|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000086_000000.wav|3752|"Then, Captain Burgess," cried North, his pale face flushing, "I tell you the boy's blood will be on your head.
2410|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000058_000001.wav|3752|"A nice example to set.

2413|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000007_000002.wav|3752|His staff, you know, mr North.
2414|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000047_000000.wav|3752|"I must also be thinking of repose," said Meekin; "the journey-though most enjoyable-has fatigued me."
2415|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000097_000003.wav|3752|He got up at length, went into the kitchen, and found a packet of red pepper.
2416|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000095_000003.wav|3752|I'll report this to the Government.
2417|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000100_000013.wav|3752|That, at all times debasing, at this particular time it was infamous; that a vice, unworthy of any man, was doubly sinful in a man of education and a minister of God.
2418|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000070_000004.wav|3752|This seems a very pleasant place, and I think I shall enjoy myself very much.
2419|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000027_000001.wav|3752|A romantic story, Captain Burgess.
2420|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000070_000005.wav|3752|Good night."
2421|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000061_000001.wav|3752|"The condition of those dormitories is infamous."
2422|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000029_000000.wav|3752|"I saw them tried at Hobart Town," said Meekin.
2423|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000079_000000.wav|3752|"That's Macklewain's business."
2424|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000080_000000.wav|3752|"Captain Burgess," protested North, "I assure you that he does not deserve punishment.
2425|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000100_000015.wav|3752|In the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard, with the bottle at his lips, in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible.
2426|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000089_000000.wav|3752|The two men looked at each other, and presently Burgess's eyes fell before those of the chaplain.
2427|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000056_000000.wav|3752|"Perhaps you'll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that," returned Macklewain, drawing up his little body to its least insignificant stature.
2428|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000011_000000.wav|3752|"If you please," said Meekin gravely.
2429|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000075_000000.wav|3752|"Well, sir, what of that?" said Burgess.
2430|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000030_000000.wav|3752|"A great rascal," put in North.
2431|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000073_000000.wav|3752|Captain Burgess was shutting his verandah window when North hurried up.

2433|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000010_000000.wav|3752|North pursed up his lips.

2435|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000100_000006.wav|3752|The taste of the liquor maddened him for more.
2436|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000050_000003.wav|3752|Macklewain, I want to speak with you a moment."
2437|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000040_000000.wav|3752|"Ha!" said North, looking wildly round upon them.
2438|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000088_000001.wav|3752|North knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such act of violence, but the insult stung him like the cut of a whip.
2439|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000034_000000.wav|3752|"I suppose severity is necessary," returned Meekin; "though to my ears a flogging sounds a little distasteful.

2442|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000070_000001.wav|3752|dear me, how dreadful!" says Meekin.
2443|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000058_000002.wav|3752|I wonder Burgess didn't give him a hundred."

2445|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000004_000000.wav|3752|"I thought it was a little paradise," said Meekin.
2446|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000072_000001.wav|3752|Good night, once more."
2447|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000033_000000.wav|3752|"Oh! there's no fear of him," said Burgess cheerily; "if he grows uproarious, we'll soon give him a touch of the cat."
2448|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000055_000001.wav|3752|"He can't stand it.
2449|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000046_000000.wav|3752|"Confound it-another of my best men," grumbled Burgess.
2450|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000039_000000.wav|3752|The Reverend Meekin eyed his clerical brother with horror.

2453|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000032_000001.wav|3752|"I wouldn't trust him."
2454|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000020_000002.wav|3752|"I was quartered with him at Sarah Island.
2455|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000099_000003.wav|3752|It was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force. "I must have a teaspoonful," he said, "to allay the craving."

2487|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000097_000005.wav|3752|It relieved him for a while.
2488|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000068_000001.wav|3752|Macklewain shook his head seriously.

2493|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000065_000000.wav|3752|"I'll go back and see Burgess," said North.

2497|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000035_000000.wav|3752|"It's a punishment for brutes," said Burgess, and laughed, pleased with the nearest approach to an epigram he ever made in his life.

2522|dev-clean/3752/4944/3752_4944_000095_000000.wav|3752|North returned home in great agitation.

2936|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000062_000000.wav|84|"I only wish to be alone.
2937|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000016_000000.wav|84|The eyes of Noirtier glistened, and d'Avrigny approached.
2938|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000056_000004.wav|84|The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by d'Avrigny.
2939|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000045_000000.wav|84|"Oh," said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone,--"oh, be satisfied, I can understand my father." D'Avrigny took the young man's arm, and led him out of the room.
2940|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000039_000000.wav|84|"The doctor?"
2941|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000010_000000.wav|84|Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who, almost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father.
2942|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000008_000003.wav|84|"Who are you, sir," he asked, "that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death? Go, sir, go!" But Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it.
2943|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000052_000000.wav|84|"Yes," replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.
2944|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000068_000000.wav|84|"Thank you, sir," said d'Avrigny; "since you have commenced your sacred office, deign to continue it.
2945|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000050_000003.wav|84|Is it not so, father?"
2946|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000012_000008.wav|84|Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest."
2947|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000054_000006.wav|84|The district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just unclosed the lips.
2948|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000024_000002.wav|84|Noirtier wishes to speak."
2949|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000062_000004.wav|84|As the doctors entered the street, they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door.
2950|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000050_000005.wav|84|Villefort continued: "He knows me, and I have pledged my word to him.
2951|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000011_000000.wav|84|"Sir," cried Morrel, seizing the moist hand of the paralytic, "they ask me who I am, and what right I have to be here.
2952|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000028_000000.wav|84|"And will you direct us?" exclaimed the young man.
2953|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000037_000001.wav|84|The procureur?"
2954|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000054_000003.wav|84|But he stopped on the landing; he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber.
2955|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000009_000007.wav|84|"See what they have done!" cried Morrel, with one hand leaning on the back of the chair, and the other extended towards Valentine.
2956|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000062_000007.wav|84|"Sir," he said, "are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter?
2957|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000029_000000.wav|84|"Do you wish me to leave?" said Morrel, sadly.
2958|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000063_000000.wav|84|"Ah," said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; "yes, I have heard that death is in that house."
2959|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000049_000000.wav|84|"Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done," said Villefort.
2960|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000031_000000.wav|84|"Alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!"
2961|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000048_000000.wav|84|"But," said Morrel, "the culprit-the murderer-the assassin."
2962|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000049_000002.wav|84|Do you not, father?"
2963|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000009_000008.wav|84|"See, my father, see!"
2964|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000055_000000.wav|84|"Alas," said d'Avrigny, "she is indeed dead, poor child!"
2965|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000019_000000.wav|84|"Sir," said Villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion,--"sir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes here.
2966|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000046_000000.wav|84|"Gentlemen," he said in a hoarse voice, "give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves!" The two men drew back.
2967|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000049_000001.wav|84|"My father has revealed the culprit's name; my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this secret.
2968|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000011_000007.wav|84|Tell them-oh, tell them, that corpse belongs to me!"
2969|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000038_000000.wav|84|"no"
2970|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000044_000000.wav|84|"Yes."
2971|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000022_000002.wav|84|"Yes, yes," continued Morrel; "recall the scene, for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.
2972|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000021_000000.wav|84|"Oh, you rave, sir," exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken.
2973|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000015_000000.wav|84|"I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office."
2974|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000012_000006.wav|84|But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth-she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men.
2975|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000042_000000.wav|84|"Yes."
2976|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000011_000004.wav|84|At length, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping, tears glistened in the eyes of Noirtier.
2977|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000027_000000.wav|84|"Yes," replied Noirtier.
2978|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000062_000003.wav|84|For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions.
2979|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000062_000006.wav|84|D'Avrigny accosted the priest.
2980|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000008_000002.wav|84|His glance, at first wandering, fixed itself upon Morrel.
2981|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000008_000000.wav|84|Villefort rose, half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief.
2982|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000012_000007.wav|84|Take a last farewell, sir, of her sad remains; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own, and then separate yourself from her forever.
2983|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000008_000001.wav|84|The terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man.
2984|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000056_000002.wav|84|He therefore approached the bed, and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face, which looked like that of a sleeping angel.
2985|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000008_000004.wav|84|"Go!--do you hear?" said Villefort, while d'Avrigny advanced to lead Morrel out.
2986|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000062_000001.wav|84|You will excuse me, will you not?
2987|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000057_000000.wav|84|"Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?" asked d'Avrigny.
2988|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000017_000000.wav|84|"Gentlemen," said Morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene, "I know what I am saying, and you know as well as I do what I am about to say-Valentine has been assassinated!" Villefort hung his head, d'Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said "Yes" with his eyes.
2989|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000054_000000.wav|84|It was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair of Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks.
2990|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000009_000000.wav|84|But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight.
2991|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000036_000000.wav|84|"no"
2992|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000061_000000.wav|84|"Do you wish to see him?"
2993|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000011_000003.wav|84|One could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death.
2994|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000010_000002.wav|84|And the cry issued from his pores, if we may thus speak-a cry frightful in its silence. D'Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative.
2995|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000067_000000.wav|84|"I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me.
2996|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000043_000000.wav|84|"But can he understand you?"
2997|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000066_000000.wav|84|"It is a young girl."
2998|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000050_000001.wav|84|Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him.
2999|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000054_000005.wav|84|Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and silent as the corpse.
3000|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000045_000002.wav|84|At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard, and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d'Avrigny and Morrel had been staying, one absorbed in meditation, the other in grief.
3001|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000054_000004.wav|84|The two doctors, therefore, entered the room alone.
3002|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000007_000001.wav|84|Maximilian.
3003|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000019_000001.wav|84|I am stricken by fate.
3004|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000017_000002.wav|84|mr Procureur," said Morrel with increasing vehemence, "no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it is your place to seek the assassin." The young man's implacable eyes interrogated Villefort, who, on his side, glanced from Noirtier to d'Avrigny.
3005|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000020_000004.wav|84|I tell you that the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time it has succeeded.
3006|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000045_000003.wav|84|"You can come," he said, and led them back to Noirtier. Morrel looked attentively on Villefort.
3007|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000069_000000.wav|84|"I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine." D'Avrigny took the priest's hand, and without meeting Villefort, who was engaged in his study, they reached Valentine's room, which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers.
3008|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000034_000000.wav|84|"Yes."
3009|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000056_000005.wav|84|Villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few words thanked the district doctor, he turned to d'Avrigny, and said,--"And now the priest."
3010|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000058_000000.wav|84|"no" said Villefort; "fetch the nearest."
3011|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000053_000001.wav|84|We have before stated that all the servants had fled.
3012|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000030_000000.wav|84|"Yes," replied Noirtier.
3013|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000017_000004.wav|84|"Yes," indicated the old man.
3014|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000065_000000.wav|84|"I was about to offer myself, sir," said the priest; "it is our mission to forestall our duties."
3015|dev-clean/84/121123/84_121123_000020_000002.wav|84|"And I say that murders are committed here," said Morrel, whose voice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: "I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months.
3016|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000016_000003.wav|6319|And yet what could he mean by the bones of our mother?"
3017|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000005_000001.wav|6319|When they were good and happy, we felt afraid lest they should become greater than ourselves; and now they are so terribly wicked that we are in worse danger than before.
3018|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000018_000001.wav|6319|"Let us go on down the mountain, and as we go, let us pick up the stones in our path and throw them over our shoulders behind us."
3019|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000016_000000.wav|6319|"Surely I do not know," said Deucalion.
3020|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000008_000001.wav|6319|Be sure that you are ready for it, my son."
3021|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000016_000002.wav|6319|Who is our mother, if it is not the Earth, from whom all living things have sprung?
3022|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000019_000000.wav|6319|"It is rather a silly thing to do," said Deucalion; "and yet there can be no harm in it, and we shall see what will happen."
3023|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000011_000002.wav|6319|While they were talking and trying to think what they should do, they heard a voice behind them.
3024|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000007_000001.wav|6319|Once every year he had gone to the land of the Caucasus to talk with his father, who was hanging chained to the mountain peak.
3025|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000018_000000.wav|6319|"Perhaps he meant the stones of the earth," said Pyrrha.
3026|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000016_000001.wav|6319|"But let us think a moment.
3027|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000005_000000.wav|6319|"These men," he said to his mighty company, "are nothing but a source of trouble.
3028|dev-clean/6319/57405/6319_57405_000012_000000.wav|6319|"Is there anything that you wish?" he asked.

3035|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000018_000002.wav|6319|Outside they met the prince's followers, who were overjoyed to see their master. He turned to show them the castle, but behold! there was no castle to be seen, and no wood; castle and wood had vanished, but the prince and princess went gayly away, and when the old king and queen died they reigned in their stead.
3036|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000015.wav|6319|At that moment, the enchantment being ended, the princess awoke, and, looking drowsily and tenderly at the young man, said:

3039|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000004_000001.wav|6319|The fairies now began to endow the princess.

3045|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000002_000001.wav|6319|When at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast, the like of which had never before been known.
3046|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000012_000002.wav|6319|That was needless, for in a quarter of an hour there had grown up about it a wood so thick and filled with thorns that nothing could get at the castle, and the castle top itself could only be seen from a great distance.
3047|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000016_000002.wav|6319|The prince was overjoyed at the words, and at the tender voice and look, and scarcely knew how to speak.
3048|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000005_000003.wav|6319|The sleep will last a hundred years, and at the end of that time a king's son will come to wake her."
3049|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000018_000000.wav|6319|When they left the castle the next day to return to the prince's home, they were followed by all the retinue of the princess.
3050|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000005_000002.wav|6319|The princess will pierce her hand with a spindle, but, instead of dying, she will only fall into a deep sleep.
3051|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000017_000002.wav|6319|Then the prince took the princess by the hand; she was dressed in great splendour, but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look; he thought her all the more charming for that.
3052|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000016_000003.wav|6319|But he managed to assure her of his love, and they soon forgot all else as they talked and talked.
3053|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000009_000000.wav|6319|"I am spinning, my fair child," said the old woman, who did not know her.
3054|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000001.wav|6319|He had not a moment's doubt that he was destined to this great adventure, and full of ardour he determined at once to set out for the castle.
3055|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000007.wav|6319|He knew that she would not awake for a hundred years.
3056|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000013.wav|6319|He drew near, trembling and wondering, and knelt beside her.
3057|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000010.wav|6319|He entered the guard room; there the guards stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders, but they were sound asleep.
3058|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000000.wav|6319|The young prince at these words felt himself on fire.
3059|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000012_000000.wav|6319|It was the work of a moment.
3060|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000002_000002.wav|6319|He asked all the fairies in the land-there were seven all told-to stand godmothers to the little princess, hoping that each might give her a gift, and so she should have all imaginable perfections.
3061|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000004_000003.wav|6319|The turn of the old fairy had now come, and she declared, while her head shook with malice, that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound. This dreadful fate threw all the company into tears of dismay, when the young fairy who had hidden herself came forward and said:
3062|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000002_000000.wav|6319|Once upon a time there was a king and a queen who grieved sorely that they had no children.
3063|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000011_000005.wav|6319|She touched the governesses, maids of honour, women of the bedchamber, gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, scullions, boys, guards, porters, pages, footmen; she touched the horses in the stable with their grooms, the great mastiffs in the court yard, and even little Pouste, the tiny lap dog of the princess that was on the bed beside her.
3064|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000011_000003.wav|6319|So this is what she did.
3065|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000011_000007.wav|6319|Even the spits before the fire, laden with partridges and pheasants, went to sleep, and the fire itself went to sleep also.
3066|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000009.wav|6319|His steps resounded as he passed over the marble pavement and up the marble staircase.
3067|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000011_000004.wav|6319|She touched with her wand everybody that was in the castle, except the king and queen.
3068|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000018_000001.wav|6319|They marched down the long avenue, and the wood opened again to let them pass.
3069|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000006.wav|6319|The king looked sorrowfully upon her.
3070|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000006_000000.wav|6319|The king, in hopes of preventing what the old fairy had foretold, immediately issued an edict by which he forbade all persons in his dominion from spinning or even having spindles in their houses under pain of instant death.
3071|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000005_000000.wav|6319|"Be of good cheer, king and queen; your daughter shall not so die.
3072|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000003.wav|6319|He walked toward the castle, which appeared now at the end of a long avenue, but when he turned to, look for his followers not one was to be seen; the woods had closed instantly upon him as he had passed through.
3073|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000017_000001.wav|6319|The lady in waiting became very impatient, and at length announced to the princess that they all waited for her.
3074|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000004.wav|6319|People came running in from all sides; they threw water in the princess's face and did all they could to restore her, but nothing would bring her to.
3075|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000000.wav|6319|"How pretty it is!" exclaimed the princess.
3076|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000013_000002.wav|6319|All manner of answers were given to him.
3077|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000008_000000.wav|6319|"What are you doing?" asked the princess.
3078|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000002.wav|6319|Give it to me that I may see if I can do it." She had no sooner taken up the spindle, than, being hasty and careless, she pierced her hand with the point of it, and fainted away.
3079|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000010_000001.wav|6319|"How do you do it?
3080|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000017_000003.wav|6319|They passed into a hall of mirrors, where they supped, attended by the officers of the princess. The violins and haut boys played old but excellent pieces of music, and after supper, to lose no time, the grand almoner married the royal lovers in the chapel of the castle.
3081|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000004_000002.wav|6319|The youngest, for her gift, decreed that she should be the most beautiful person in the world; the next that she should have the mind of an angel; the third that she should be perfectly graceful; the fourth that she should dance admirably well; the fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; the sixth, that she should play charmingly upon every musical instrument.
3082|dev-clean/6319/64726/6319_64726_000015_000011.wav|6319|He passed through one apartment after another, where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing.
3083|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000004_000000.wav|6319|THE WIND AND THE FLOWERS
3084|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000017_000000.wav|6319|"Not more than mine does!" cried the proud white Lily, leaning as heavily as she could against the strip of matting that tied her to her stick.
3085|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000024_000000.wav|6319|At length, one day before the fortnight was over, the house dog was heard to bark his noisy welcome, and servants bustled to and fro. The mistress had returned; and the young lady was with her, and hurried at once to her favourite garden.
3086|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000023_000000.wav|6319|Before the day closed, the gardener came whistling from his farm work, to look over his pretty charges.
3087|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000022_000007.wav|6319|She felt the muddy weight as it soaked into her beautiful velvet bells, and could have cried for grief: she could never free herself from this nuisance.
3088|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000017_000003.wav|6319|He murmured among them all-laughed the trim cut Box edges to scorn-maliciously hoped the Sweet Peas enjoyed growing in a circle, and running up a quantity of crooked sticks-and told the flowers, generally, that he should report their unheard of submission and meek obedience wherever he went.
3089|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000008_000005.wav|6319|Sometimes she takes a turn upon the ground; sometimes she enters a hedge, and plays at bo peep with the birds in the thorn and nut trees-twisting here, curling there, and at last, perhaps, coming out at the top, and overhanging the edge with a canopy of green leaves and pretty white flowers.
3090|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000018_000000.wav|6319|Then the white Lily called out to him in great wrath, and told him he mistook their characters altogether.
3091|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000022_000003.wav|6319|The white Lily still stood somewhat upright, though no friendly pole supported her juicy stem; but, alas! it was only by a painful effort she could hold herself in that position.
3092|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000024_000002.wav|6319|Presently, with sorrowing steps, she bent her way round the flower beds, weeping afresh at every one she looked at; and then she sat down upon the lawn, and hid her face in her hands. In this position she remained, until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder.
3093|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000016_000003.wav|6319|"Always this tying up and restraint!" pursued the Wind, with an angry puff.
3094|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000024_000001.wav|6319|She came bounding towards the well-known spot with a song of joyous delight; but, on reaching it, suddenly stopped short, and in a minute after burst into a flood of tears!
3095|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000022_000002.wav|6319|But towards the evening the weather cleared up, and our friends began to look around them.
3096|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000023_000002.wav|6319|But for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all. Struck dumb with astonishment, he never spoke at first, but kept lifting up the heads of the trailing, dirtied flowers in succession.
3097|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000023_000007.wav|6319|Weeds meanwhile sprang up, and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden.
3098|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000010_000002.wav|6319|My young plants require heat, or they would not live; and the pots we are kept in protect us from those cruel wire worms who delight to destroy our roots."
3099|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000015_000000.wav|6319|And so she did, and a new light seemed to dawn upon her as she recollected the spring and autumnal prunings she regularly underwent, and the quantities of little branches that were yearly cut from her sides, and carried away in a wheel barrow.
3100|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000011_000002.wav|6319|Why not allow your silver tufts to luxuriate in a natural manner?
3101|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000008_000001.wav|6319|"You surely cannot suppose that in a natural state you would be forced to climb regularly up one tall bare stick such as I see you upon now.
3102|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000022_000009.wav|6319|The Honeysuckle escaped no better; and the Carnation was ready to die of vexation, at finding that her coveted freedom had levelled her to the dirt.
3103|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000022_000000.wav|6319|Meanwhile, how fared it with the flowers?
3104|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000008_000007.wav|6319|I quite feel for you!
3105|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000023_000004.wav|6319|It's all over with them, I fear;" and the gardener went his way.
3106|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000026_000000.wav|6319|"I am not thinking about the garden, mamma," replied the young girl, without lifting up her face; "we can plant new flowers, and tie up even some of these afresh.
3107|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000017_000002.wav|6319|Indeed, not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions.
3108|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000014_000005.wav|6319|Oh, Rose Tree, you know your own surpassing merits too well to make you think this possible!"
3109|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000022_000005.wav|6319|The Convolvulus fared still worse.
3110|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000006_000000.wav|6319|"What a fuss is made about you, my dear little friends!" murmured the Wind, one day, to the flowers in a pretty villa garden.
3111|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000019_000000.wav|6319|To which the wicked Wind, seeing that his temptations had succeeded, replied, in great glee, that he would do his best; and so he went away, chuckling at the discontent he had caused.
3112|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000014_000002.wav|6319|Why not allow the healthy Rose Tree its free and glorious growth?
3113|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000016_000001.wav|6319|He really grieved to see it!
3114|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000016_000000.wav|6319|Then the Wind took another frolic round the garden, and made up to the large white Lily, into whose refined ear he whispered a doubt as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid, ugly stick!
3115|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000006_000002.wav|6319|I have been watching your friend the gardener for some time to day; and now that he is gone at last, I am quite curious to hear what you think and feel about your unnatural bringing up."
3116|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000009_000000.wav|6319|Now the Convolvulus was quite abashed by the words of the Wind, for she was conscious of feeling very conceited that morning, in consequence of having heard the gardener say something very flattering about her beauty; so she hung down her rich bell flowers rather lower than usual, and made no reply.
3117|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000010_000001.wav|6319|I am not aware that I have any poor relations in this country, and I myself certainly require all the care that is bestowed upon me. This climate is both too cold and too damp for me.
3118|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000026_000003.wav|6319|But I cannot say so, now I see the result.
3119|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000022_000008.wav|6319|Oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fir pole!
3120|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000023_000005.wav|6319|Alas! what he said was true; and before many days had passed, the shattered Carnations were rotted with lying in the wet and dirt on the ground.
3121|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000021_000002.wav|6319|In short, in one half hour he desolated the pretty garden; and when his work was accomplished, he flew off.
3122|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000022_000001.wav|6319|The Wind was scarcely gone before a sudden and heavy rain followed, so that all was confusion for some time.
3123|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000013_000001.wav|6319|What a difference in size, in colour and in fragrance!
3124|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000008_000004.wav|6319|She runs along and climbs about, just as the whim takes her.
3125|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000011_000003.wav|6319|Why must every single flower betied up by its delicate neck to a stick, the moment it begins to open?
3126|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000011_000004.wav|6319|Really, with your natural grace and beauty, I think you might be trusted to yourself a little more!"
3127|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000008_000000.wav|6319|"I smile at your question," was the answer of the Wind.
3128|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000016_000004.wav|6319|"Perhaps I am prejudiced; but as to be deprived of freedom would be to me absolute death, so my soul revolts from every shape and phase of slavery!"
3129|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000021_000000.wav|6319|He managed the affair very cleverly, it must be confessed.
3130|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000012_000000.wav|6319|And the Carnation began to think so, too; and her colour turned deeper as a feeling of indignation arose within her at the childish treatment to which she had been subjected.
3131|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000025_000000.wav|6319|"This is a sad sight, indeed, my darling," said her mother's voice.
3132|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000021_000001.wav|6319|Making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden, he knocked over the Convolvulus pole, tore the strips from the stick that held up the white Lily, loosed all the Carnation flowers from their fastenings, broke the Rose Tree down, and levelled the Sweet Peas to the ground.
3133|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000012_000001.wav|6319|"With my natural grace and beauty," repeated she to herself, "they might certainly trust me to myself a little more!"
3134|dev-clean/6319/275224/6319_275224_000022_000006.wav|6319|The garden beds sloped towards the south; and when our friend was laid on the earth-her pole having fallen-her lovely flowers were choked up by the wet soil which drained towards her.

3149|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000015_000000.wav|5338|As they entered, the girl sighed and laid down her work.

3163|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000031_000000.wav|5338|"In that case," said Button Bright, "you're entitled to the best there is, to pay for your trouble.

3166|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000010_000000.wav|5338|"A splendid palace!" exclaimed one of the Pinkies, and then they looked at one another in amazement and seemed to doubt that their ears had heard aright.
3167|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000034_000000.wav|5338|"I have one great privilege.
3168|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000024_000000.wav|5338|"By no means," was the prompt reply.
3169|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000028_000000.wav|5338|"Why?" asked Tourmaline, curiously.
3170|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000054_000003.wav|5338|I'll look in the Great Book first.

3172|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000032_000004.wav|5338|If I lived as luxuriously as my people do, and had servants and costly gowns, the good Pinkies would say that their Queen had more than they themselves-and it would be true.
3173|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000016_000000.wav|5338|"What is it, Coralie?" she asked the woman.
3174|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000014_000001.wav|5338|She was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age, not fat like all the rest of the Pinkies, but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty.
3175|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000054_000002.wav|5338|But, if there is no other way, I may be obliged to call upon Rosalie for help.
3176|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000034_000002.wav|5338|That is my reward."
3177|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000032_000003.wav|5338|In that case my subjects would justly grow envious of my superior station.
3178|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000021_000000.wav|5338|"Majesty!" she exclaimed, flushing a deeper pink.
3179|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000036_000002.wav|5338|It is much more desirable to be a private citizen, happy and care free.

3181|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000013_000001.wav|5338|The people must wait outside, for there is no room for them in the palace."
3182|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000049_000000.wav|5338|"If not," said the woman, "you must make a law.

3186|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000013_000000.wav|5338|"Come!" commanded the woman who led the party; "you three must follow me to the presence of Tourmaline.
3187|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000004_000000.wav|5338|The open space which they entered was paved with pink marble and around it were two rows of large pink statues, at least life-size and beautifully sculptured.

3193|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000008_000001.wav|5338|Did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome residences?" asked the woman, evidently surprised.
3194|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000044_000000.wav|5338|"But what can you do here?" asked Tourmaline.

3202|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000023_000002.wav|5338|Coralie, do you consider 'majesty' a proper word to use when addressing a Queen?" she added, appealing to the Pinky woman.
3203|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000050_000000.wav|5338|"I know," answered Tourmaline; "but I hope such a responsibility will not fall upon my shoulders.

3206|dev-clean/5338/284437/5338_284437_000018_000001.wav|5338|She smiled-a little sadly-at Trot, seemed to approve Button Bright's open, frank face and was quite surprised because Cap'n Bill was so much bigger than her own people.

3240|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000004.wav|7976|Hansel thought the roof tasted very nice, and so he tore off a great piece; while Grethel broke a large round pane out of the window, and sat down quite contentedly.
3241|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000026_000000.wav|7976|It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house, and they still walked on; but they only got deeper, and deeper, and deeper into the wood, and Hansel felt that if help did not come very soon they must die of hunger.
3242|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000026_000001.wav|7976|As soon as it was noon they saw a beautiful, snow white bird sitting upon a bough, singing so sweetly that they stood still and listened to it.
3243|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000022_000002.wav|7976|"Hansel, why do you stop and look about?" said the father, "keep in the path." "I am looking at my little dove," answered Hansel, "nodding a good bye to me." "Simpleton!" said the wife, "that is no dove, but only the sun shining on the chimney." But Hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he went along.
3244|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000032_000002.wav|7976|"These are better than pebbles," said Hansel, putting as many into his pocket as it would hold; while Grethel thought, "I will take some home too," and filled her apron full.
3245|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000010.wav|7976|Witches have red eyes, and cannot see very far; but they have a fine sense of smelling, like wild beasts, so that they know when children approach them.
3246|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000000.wav|7976|"We will go in here," said Hansel, "and have a glorious feast.
3247|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000002.wav|7976|Will they not be sweet?" So Hansel reached up and broke a piece off the roof, in order to see how it tasted; while Grethel stepped up to the window and began to bite it.
3248|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000029_000004.wav|7976|See, I could even get in myself!" and she got up, and put her head into the oven.
3249|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000028_000002.wav|7976|"Dear good God, help us now!" she prayed.
3250|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000016_000002.wav|7976|When they awoke, it was quite dark, and Grethel began to cry.
3251|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000008.wav|7976|A good meal of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples and nuts, was spread on the table, and in the back room were two nice little beds, covered with white, where Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down, and were happy as could be.
3252|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000020_000000.wav|7976|He who says A must say B too; and he who consents the first time must also the second.

3254|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000011_000000.wav|7976|"Be quiet, Grethel," said he; "do not cry-I will help you." And as soon as their parents had gone to sleep, he got up, put on his coat, and, unbarring the back door, went out.
3255|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000021_000001.wav|7976|Nevertheless he comforted Grethel, saying, "Do not weep; sleep in quiet; the good God will not forsake us."
3256|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000029_000001.wav|7976|"First, we will bake, however," said the old woman; "I have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough;" and so saying, she pushed poor Grethel up to the oven, out of which the flames were burning fiercely.
3257|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000013_000000.wav|7976|"Ah, father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house, and trying to say good bye."
3258|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000032_000001.wav|7976|And now, as there was nothing to fear, they went back to the witch's house, where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones.
3259|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000021_000000.wav|7976|The children, however, had heard the conversation as they lay awake, and as soon as their parents went to sleep Hansel got up, intending to pick up some pebbles as before; but the wife had locked the door, so that he could not get out.
3260|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000009_000000.wav|7976|"Oh, you simpleton!" said she, "then we must all four die of hunger; you had better plane the coffins for us." But she left him no peace till he consented, saying, "Ah, but I shall miss the poor children."
3261|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000012_000002.wav|7976|When they had gone a little distance, Hansel stood still, and peeped back at the house; and this he repeated several times, till his father said, "Hansel, what are you looking at, and why do you lag behind?
3262|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000024_000000.wav|7976|When noon came, Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewn his on the path.
3263|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000014_000000.wav|7976|"You simpleton!" said the wife, "that is not a cat; it is only the sun shining on the white chimney." But in reality Hansel was not looking at a cat; but every time he stopped, he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path.
3264|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000006_000001.wav|7976|He had little enough to break or bite; and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he could hardly procure even his daily bread; and as he lay thinking in his bed one night, he sighed, and said to his wife, "What will become of us? How can we feed our children, when we have no more than we can eat ourselves?"
3265|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000005.wav|7976|Just then the door opened, and a very old woman, walking upon crutches, came out.
3266|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000036_000002.wav|7976|This the good little bird did, and when both were happily arrived on the other side, and had gone a little way, they came to a well-known wood, which they knew the better every step they went, and at last they perceived their father's house.
3267|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000036_000003.wav|7976|Then they began to run, and rushing into the house, they fell upon their father's neck.
3268|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000015_000002.wav|7976|Then they set fire to them; and as the flame burnt up high, the wife said, "Now, you children, lie down near the fire, and rest yourselves, whilst we go into the forest and chop more wood; when we are ready we will come and call you."
3269|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000005_000000.wav|7976|HANSEL AND GRETHEL
3270|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000031_000000.wav|7976|Now she ran to Hansel, and, opening the door, called out, "Hansel we are saved; the old witch is dead?"
3271|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000036_000001.wav|7976|"No," replied Grethel, "that will be too much for the Duck, she shall take us over one at a time."
3272|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000019_000000.wav|7976|But her husband felt heavy at heart, and thought, "It were better to share the last crust with the children." His wife, however, would listen to nothing that he said, and scolded and reproached him without end.
3273|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000033_000000.wav|7976|"We must be off now," said Hansel, "and get out of this enchanted forest;" but when they had walked for two hours they came to a large piece of water.
3274|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000012_000003.wav|7976|Take care, and remember your legs."
3275|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000024_000002.wav|7976|Hansel kept saying to Grethel, "We will soon find the way;" but they did not, and they walked the whole night long and the next day, but still they did not come out of the wood; and they got very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the berries which they found upon the bushes.
3276|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000022_000000.wav|7976|Early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed, and gave them each a slice of bread, which was still smaller than the former piece.
3277|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000028_000000.wav|7976|Every morning the old witch came to the cage and said, "Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel whether you are getting fat." But Hansel used to stretch out a bone, and the old woman, having very bad sight, thought it was his finger, and wondered very much why he did not get fat.
3278|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000032_000000.wav|7976|So he sprang out, like a bird from his cage when the door was opened; and they were so glad that they fell upon each other's neck, and kissed each other over and over again.
3279|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000012.wav|7976|So a nice meal was cooked for Hansel, but Grethel got nothing else but a crab's claw.
3280|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000016_000006.wav|7976|Why did you sleep so long in the wood?
3281|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000029_000006.wav|7976|Oh! how horribly the witch howled; but Grethel ran away, and left her to burn to ashes.
3282|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000006.wav|7976|Hansel and Grethel were so much frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands; but the old woman nodding her head, said, "Ah, you dear children, what has brought you here?
3283|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000012_000000.wav|7976|The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and awoke the two children.
3284|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000016_000007.wav|7976|We thought you were never coming home again." But their father was extremely glad, for it had grieved his heart to leave them all alone.
3285|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000010_000001.wav|7976|Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, "What will become of us?"
3286|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000008_000000.wav|7976|"No, wife," replied he, "that I can never do; how can you bring your heart to leave my children all alone in the wood; for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to pieces?"
3287|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000016_000000.wav|7976|Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and when it was noon, each ate the piece of bread; and because they could hear the blows of an axe they thought their father was near; but it was not an axe, but a branch which he had bound to an old tree, so as to be blown to and fro by the wind.
3288|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000001.wav|7976|I will eat a piece of the roof, and you can eat the window.
3289|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000024_000003.wav|7976|Soon they were so tired that they could not drag themselves along, then they lay down under a tree and again went to sleep.
3290|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000029_000005.wav|7976|Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she fell right in, and shutting the iron door bolted it.
3291|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000027_000007.wav|7976|Come in and stop with me, and no harm shall come to you;" and so saying she took them both by the hand, and led them into her cottage.
3292|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000023_000001.wav|7976|We are going into the forest to hew wood, and in the evening, when we are ready, we will come and fetch you again."
3293|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000016_000005.wav|7976|They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel, she exclaimed, "You wicked children!
3294|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000035_000000.wav|7976|"Little Duck, good little Duck, Grethel and Hansel, together we stand; There is neither stile nor bridge, Take us on your back to land."
3295|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000034_000000.wav|7976|"We cannot get over," said Hansel; "I can see no bridge at all." "And there is no boat either," said Grethel, "but there swims a white duck, I will ask her to help us over;" and she sang,
3296|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000036_000000.wav|7976|So the Duck came to them, and Hansel sat himself on, and bade his sister sit beside him.

3298|dev-clean/7976/110523/7976_110523_000006_000000.wav|7976|Once upon a time there dwelt near a large wood a poor wood cutter, with his wife, and two children by his former marriage, a little boy called Hansel, and a girl named Grethel.

3435|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000023_000000.wav|7976|However, in spite of all she could say, the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the beggar.

3438|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000041_000001.wav|7976|I was suspicious of her from the first."
3439|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000027_000000.wav|7976|"For shame!" cried the eldest.
3440|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000033_000000.wav|7976|The youngest sister peeped through her long heavy eyelashes and watched the beggar.
3441|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000033_000002.wav|7976|She was so terribly frightened that it was all she could do to keep her teeth from chattering.
3442|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000053_000002.wav|7976|The doors were strong and held securely.

3447|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000032_000001.wav|7976|The beggar entered the room.
3448|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000023_000003.wav|7976|They gave him his supper in the kitchen and then they ate their own.

3452|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000014_000001.wav|7976|The captain of the band had watched the merchant's departure, and when he was safely away the thief dressed himself in the disguise of an old beggar. When it was evening he led his band into a nearby street and in his disguise approached the merchant's house.

3464|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000043_000000.wav|7976|The leader of the band of thieves went up close to the keyhole and whispered: "Kind lady of the house, have pity on me."
3465|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000054_000001.wav|7976|When they heard their sister's story they were filled with amazement.

3467|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000032_000000.wav|7976|Soon she heard footsteps.

3477|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000019_000002.wav|7976|We can give this poor beggar some alms and send him away with a blessing."
3478|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000039_000000.wav|7976|Soon she heard footsteps outside.
3479|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000021_000000.wav|7976|The second daughter added.
3480|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000030_000000.wav|7976|While they were talking, the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for dessert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them.

3485|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000005_000000.wav|7976|Long ago there lived a merchant who had three daughters.
3486|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000048_000000.wav|7976|"It's in the fire," replied the girl.
3487|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000049_000000.wav|7976|"Go throw vinegar on the fire and put it out," said the captain of the thieves.
3488|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000020_000001.wav|7976|"It is not for the youngest and most childish one of us to make the plans," she said.
3489|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000061_000001.wav|7976|"All my worries about you were foolish."
3490|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000032_000008.wav|7976|The robber thought that she was as completely overcome by the sleeping powder as the others.
3491|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000050_000000.wav|7976|Now it happened that there was a little hole in the door just large enough for a man's hand to enter.
3492|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000041_000000.wav|7976|"It was the youngest one who deceived me!" cried the robber chieftain. "I knew all the time that she did not want to let me in.
3493|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000055_000000.wav|7976|"I don't believe a word of it!" cried the oldest.
3494|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000036_000002.wav|7976|The little girl flew down the stairs and closed the doors of the store securely.
3495|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000031_000000.wav|7976|As soon as they had eaten, the girls went to their room, and the two eldest were overcome with sleep almost before they had time to get into bed.
3496|dev-clean/7976/110124/7976_110124_000034_000001.wav|7976|Then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store.
3497|dev-clean/5694/64038/5694_64038_000007_000001.wav|5694|It took us four months in the first instance, and but little longer than as many days in the second, to get back to Dalton, our starting point.

3502|dev-clean/5694/64038/5694_64038_000008_000000.wav|5694|We passed all those glorious battlefields, that have been made classic in history, frequently coming across the skull of some poor fellow sitting on top of a stump, grinning a ghastly smile; also the bones of horses along the road, and fences burned and destroyed, and occasionally the charred remains of a once fine dwelling house.
3503|dev-clean/5694/64038/5694_64038_000015_000004.wav|5694|The earth seemed to have opened and swallowed him.

3572|dev-clean/5694/64029/5694_64029_000013_000013.wav|5694|I remember that they had to cross an open field in our front, and we were lying behind a fence, and as they advanced, we kept up firing, and would run them back every time, until they brought up a regiment that whooped, and yelled, and charged our skirmish line, and then we fell back again.
3573|dev-clean/5694/64029/5694_64029_000005_000004.wav|5694|At the time mentioned, I was standing about two hundred yards off the road, the main body of the pickets being on the Nashville and Murfreesboro turnpike, and commanded by Lieutenant Hardy Murfree, of the Rutherford Rifles.

3956|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000038_000000.wav|1462|"I understand, Bartley.
3957|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000019_000001.wav|1462|But it's worse now.

3977|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000009_000000.wav|1462|Hilda took a quick, soft breath.
3978|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000041_000001.wav|1462|She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.

3982|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000028_000000.wav|1462|Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.

3985|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000047_000000.wav|1462|She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer.

3988|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000005_000001.wav|1462|I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train."

3995|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000011_000001.wav|1462|At last Alexander brought out one word:--

3997|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000039_000000.wav|1462|"I can't," he said heavily.

4001|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000002_000012.wav|1462|But why do you let me chatter on like this?

4003|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000043_000005.wav|1462|It's different now.
4004|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000013_000001.wav|1462|She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley.

4009|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000001_000001.wav|1462|The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
4010|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000016_000001.wav|1462|He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
4011|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000006_000001.wav|1462|Hilda watched him with perplexity.
4012|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000006_000000.wav|1462|Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.

4015|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000043_000004.wav|1462|It's getting the better of me.
4016|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000046_000004.wav|1462|The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful-can I never make you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently.
4017|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000019_000000.wav|1462|"Always.

4020|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000022_000001.wav|1462|She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.
4021|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000024_000000.wav|1462|He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.

4026|dev-clean/1462/170142/1462_170142_000017_000000.wav|1462|Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows growing about her eyes.

4060|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000008_000000.wav|1462|Alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm.

4062|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000003_000004.wav|1462|Over the fireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror.

4065|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000012_000006.wav|1462|I told myself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of myself, a letter would be better than nothing.
4066|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000011_000005.wav|1462|Give me my things, please." She put her hand out toward the fender.

4069|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000021_000000.wav|1462|Alexander moved restlessly.
4070|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000005_000000.wav|1462|"Come in," he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her.

4104|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000013_000004.wav|1462|Then I wouldn't have come."
4105|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000013_000000.wav|1462|Hilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve.

4118|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000024_000003.wav|1462|It's because they can't be at the mercy of the man they love any longer."
4119|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000008_000002.wav|1462|Let me take off your coat-and your boots; they're oozing water." He knelt down and began to unlace her shoes, while Hilda shrank into the chair.

4121|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000015_000001.wav|1462|But when I came, I thought I had been mistaken."
4122|dev-clean/1462/170145/1462_170145_000027_000001.wav|1462|He got up and went over to the window, threw it open, and leaned out.

4274|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000009_000003.wav|2412|They seemed concerned and uneasy as soon as they got hold of it.
4275|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000007_000001.wav|2412|I will spare the reader any description of the town, and would only bid him think of Domodossola or Faido.
4276|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000013_000002.wav|2412|The design was different, but the thing was clearly the same.
4277|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000006_000002.wav|2412|Goats were abundant; also a kind of small black cattle, in the marshes near the river, which was now fast widening, and running between larger flats from which the hills receded more and more.
4278|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000008_000010.wav|2412|This gave me little uneasiness, for I had no money with me, nor anything which they were at all likely to want, or which I cared about losing.
4279|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000002_000004.wav|2412|However, I showed no sign of wonder or disapproval; for I remembered that to be all things to all men was one of the injunctions of the Gentile Apostle, which for the present I should do well to heed.
4280|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000005_000002.wav|2412|The children were infinite in number, and exceedingly merry; I need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty.
4281|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000004_000001.wav|2412|I never saw anything in the least comparable to them. The women were vigorous, and had a most majestic gait, their heads being set upon their shoulders with a grace beyond all power of expression. Each feature was finished, eyelids, eyelashes, and ears being almost invariably perfect.
4282|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000002_000003.wav|2412|My hosts always bowed their heads as they passed one of these shrines, and it shocked me to see statues that had no apparent object, beyond the chronicling of some unusual individual excellence or beauty, receive so serious a homage.
4283|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000007_000004.wav|2412|The other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self-contained, and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him.
4284|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000007_000000.wav|2412|In about four hours of walking from the time we started, and after passing two or three more villages, we came upon a considerable town, and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something, but I gathered no inkling of their meaning, except that I need be under no apprehension of danger.
4285|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000002_000006.wav|2412|But it was not so.
4286|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000008_000009.wav|2412|As soon as it was ended, they proceeded to overhaul my swag and the contents of my pockets.
4287|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000007_000006.wav|2412|These two were first called out; and in about a quarter of an hour I was made to follow them, which I did in some fear, and with much curiosity.
4288|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000008_000001.wav|2412|He looked me all over for about five minutes, letting his eyes wander from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, up and down, and down and up; neither did his mind seem in the least clearer when he had done looking than when he began.
4289|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000006_000003.wav|2412|I saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails. Dogs were there in plenty, and very English; but I saw no cats, nor indeed are these creatures known, their place being supplied by a sort of small terrier.
4290|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000013_000000.wav|2412|We passed many cases, and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches.
4291|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000009_000001.wav|2412|When I had shown them what I did with it, they were astonished but not displeased, and seemed to like the smell.
4292|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000012_000005.wav|2412|As I said before, all were marred and broken.
4293|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000008_000011.wav|2412|At least I fancied so, but I soon found my mistake.
4294|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000002_000002.wav|2412|Sometimes we went through forests of pine, or rather yew trees, though they looked like pine; and I remember that now and again we passed a little wayside shrine, wherein there would be a statue of great beauty, representing some figure, male or female, in the very heyday of youth, strength, and beauty, or of the most dignified maturity and old age.
4295|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000012_000001.wav|2412|The larger specimens had a case to themselves, and tickets with writing on them in a character which I could not understand.
4296|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000008_000005.wav|2412|They felt my pulse, they looked at my tongue, they listened at my chest, they felt all my muscles; and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded, and said something in a tone quite pleasant, as though I were all right.
4297|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000004_000003.wav|2412|Their expression was divine; and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment, I forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly.
4298|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000013_000001.wav|2412|Here the magistrate stopped, and opening the case began comparing my watch with the others.
4299|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000005_000001.wav|2412|I have always delighted in and reverenced beauty; but I felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type-a compound of all that is best in Egyptian, Greek and Italian.
4300|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000010_000000.wav|2412|I remember that when they first found it I had thought of Paley, and how he tells us that a savage on seeing a watch would at once conclude that it was designed.
4301|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000002_000000.wav|2412|We followed an Alpine path for some four miles, now hundreds of feet above a brawling stream which descended from the glaciers, and now nearly alongside it.
4302|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000005_000000.wav|2412|The men were as handsome as the women beautiful.
4303|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000008_000006.wav|2412|They even pulled down my eyelids, and looked, I suppose, to see if they were bloodshot; but it was not so.
4304|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000004_000000.wav|2412|Lastly, I should say that the people were of a physical beauty which was simply amazing.
4305|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000011_000001.wav|2412|He spoke to me solemnly and sternly for two or three minutes.
4306|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000004_000005.wav|2412|Even in middle age they were still comely, and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity, not to say majesty, of their own.
4307|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000002_000007.wav|2412|My guides spoke to many in passing, and those spoken to showed much amazement.
4308|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000005_000003.wav|2412|I expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides, and they were greatly pleased.
4309|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000007_000003.wav|2412|In fact, one of them was plainly very much out of health, and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it.
4310|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000006_000000.wav|2412|When we had got past the village the fog rose, and revealed magnificent views of the snowy mountains and their nearer abutments, while in front I could now and again catch glimpses of the great plains which I had surveyed on the preceding evening.
4311|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000004_000002.wav|2412|Their colour was equal to that of the finest Italian paintings; being of the clearest olive, and yet ruddy with a glow of perfect health.
4312|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000008_000003.wav|2412|He appeared more and more puzzled, and then retired, returning with two others much like himself.
4313|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000003_000003.wav|2412|It was here as hitherto: all things were generically the same as in Europe, the differences being of species only; and I was amused at seeing in a window some bottles with barley sugar and sweetmeats for children, as at home; but the barley sugar was in plates, not in twisted sticks, and was coloured blue.
4314|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000007_000005.wav|2412|Both of them appeared astonished at seeing one who was evidently a stranger, but they were too ill to come up to me, and form conclusions concerning me.
4315|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000003_000000.wav|2412|The village was just like the one we had left, only rather larger.
4316|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000002_000009.wav|2412|I may as well say at once what my after experience taught me-namely, that with all their faults and extraordinary obliquity of mental vision upon many subjects, they are the very best bred people that I ever fell in with.
4317|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000009_000002.wav|2412|But by and by they came to my watch, which I had hidden away in the inmost pocket that I had, and had forgotten when they began their search.
4318|dev-clean/2412/153954/2412_153954_000005_000005.wav|2412|I could fill many pages with a description of their dress and the ornaments which they wore, and a hundred details which struck me with all the force of novelty; but I must not stay to do so.
4319|dev-clean/2412/153947/2412_153947_000030_000000.wav|2412|I also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the Musical Banks, and the trial of a man for being in a consumption.
4320|dev-clean/2412/153947/2412_153947_000014_000000.wav|2412|The Author wishes it to be understood that Erewhon is pronounced as a word of three syllables, all short-thus, E re whon.
4321|dev-clean/2412/153947/2412_153947_000017_000001.wav|2412|This is a mistake, though a perfectly natural one.
4322|dev-clean/2412/153947/2412_153947_000029_000000.wav|2412|The next part of "Erewhon" that I wrote was the "World of the Unborn," a preliminary form of which was sent to mr Holyoake's paper, but as I cannot find it among those copies of the Reasoner that are in the British Museum, I conclude that it was not accepted.
4323|dev-clean/2412/153947/2412_153947_000034_000000.wav|2412|Having now, I fear, at too great length done what I was asked to do, I should like to add a few words on my own account.
4324|dev-clean/2412/153947/2412_153947_000017_000006.wav|2412|Then I had much pleasure in reading it, but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books, in spite of their entire independence to one another.

4327|dev-clean/2412/153947/2412_153947_000020_000004.wav|2412|I have also parted with the word "infortuniam" (though not without regret), but have not dared to meddle with other similar inaccuracies.
4328|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000023_000003.wav|6345|It would have turned out all right with them.

4330|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000024_000002.wav|6345|What is it?
4331|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000042_000001.wav|6345|I will catch the night train, and bring my mother up to morrow.
4332|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000006_000001.wav|6345|He sprang to his feet-this was, indeed, too much!
4333|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000011_000000.wav|6345|She hesitated, then struck a chord or two and began another of those little tuneful Italian songs, all stars and flowers and hearts of gold. And again he listened with a quiet pleasure.
4334|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000035_000000.wav|6345|Her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently.
4335|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000015_000001.wav|6345|Then she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round the laurel bushes.
4336|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000025_000000.wav|6345|She drank obediently.
4337|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000037_000000.wav|6345|She stopped short, and looked at him through the dusk.
4338|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000003_000000.wav|6345|THE last strains of the ill treated, ill fated "Intermezzo" had died away, and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous barrel organ that had so gaily executed that, along with the nine other tunes of its repertory, to the admiration of the housemaid at the window of the house opposite, and the crowing delight of the two babies next door.
4339|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000009_000001.wav|6345|She turned quickly, and came back two steps.
4340|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000008_000002.wav|6345|He stood with his hand on the curtain, listening-and with a pleasure that astonished him.
4341|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000054_000001.wav|6345|I told you so!" said his mother at once-and the young man sat down at his study table and looked at the title of his article on "The Decadence of Criticism." It was surely a very long time ago that he had written that.
4342|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000051_000001.wav|6345|He did not kiss it then, only took it in his, and felt how small and cold it was.

4345|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000019_000000.wav|6345|"Here-I say, you know-don't-" he said.
4346|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000019_000005.wav|6345|I was thinking of French.
4347|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000023_000002.wav|6345|I might have known I couldn't do it, though it's just what girls in books would do.
4348|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000054_000002.wav|6345|And he sat there thinking, till his mother's voice roused him.

4371|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000039_000005.wav|6345|I feel as if I had been beaten."
4372|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000019_000006.wav|6345|Oh, Lord!"
4373|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000046_000003.wav|6345|You see, papa's so very rich, and at home they expect me to-to get acquainted with dukes and things-and-"
4374|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000049_000000.wav|6345|"It wasn't I who said that," said the girl, smiling; "but that's so, anyhow." And then she sighed.
4375|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000014_000001.wav|6345|"Wouldn't you like to sit down and rest? There is a seat in the garden at the side of the house."
4376|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000057_000004.wav|6345|It was plain that his castanet girl-his mother and sister took a pleasure in crediting her daily with some fresh and unpleasing instrument-could have had neither taste, money, nor honesty to such a point as this.
4377|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000013_000000.wav|6345|Never had any act seemed so impossible.
4378|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000023_000004.wav|6345|Let me go-thank you very much.
4379|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000024_000000.wav|6345|"Look here," he said, "this is all nonsense, you know.
4380|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000028_000001.wav|6345|Her eyes filled again with tears.
4381|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000024_000004.wav|6345|Perhaps I can help you."
4382|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000026_000001.wav|6345|He had no time to think, but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him.
4383|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000051_000002.wav|6345|Then it was taken away.
4384|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000050_000001.wav|6345|"All the same," he added irrelevantly, "you shall have the latch key."
4385|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000030_000001.wav|6345|Why, that's nothing.
4386|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000043_000001.wav|6345|Love at first sight is all nonsense, we know-we who have come to forty year-but at twenty one one does not somehow recognise it for the nonsense it is.

4388|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000032_000001.wav|6345|You've quarrelled with your friends, and-Ah, tell me-and let me try to help you."
4389|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000010_000000.wav|6345|"Won't you sing again?" he asked.
4390|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000008_000005.wav|6345|He threw back the curtain and leaned out of the window.
4391|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000043_000000.wav|6345|The only excuse for this rash young man is to be found in the fact that while he was feeding his strange guest with cake and wine she was feeding, with her beauty, the first fire of his first love.
4392|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000022_000000.wav|6345|She looked at him and spoke for the first time.
4393|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000009_000002.wav|6345|She wore the dress of a Contadina, a very smart dress indeed, and her hands looked small and white.
4394|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000026_000000.wav|6345|He hurriedly cut cake and pressed it upon her.
4395|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000004_000000.wav|6345|The young man drew a deep breath of relief, and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing table, for now the late summer dusk was falling, and that organ, please Heaven, made full the measure of the day's appointed torture.
4396|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000031_000000.wav|6345|She laughed.
4397|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000014_000000.wav|6345|"Aren't you tired?" he said.
4398|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000023_000000.wav|6345|"It serves me right," she said in excellent, yet unfamiliar, English.
4399|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000020_000001.wav|6345|She rose.
4400|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000009_000000.wav|6345|"Here!" he called to the figure that moved slowly towards the gate.
4401|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000008_000000.wav|6345|and so forth.

4405|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000008_000004.wav|6345|Then there was silence-then a sigh, and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel.
4406|dev-clean/6345/93306/6345_93306_000056_000002.wav|6345|She spent the rest of that day in searching the house for further losses, but all things were in their place, except the silver handled button hook-and that, as even his sister owned, had been missing for months.

4413|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000007_000009.wav|6345|She was out of place, and much unwelcome.
4414|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000012.wav|6345|I know it, and there is no waking.
4415|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000014_000002.wav|6345|But she neither loved the light nor mourned the shadow.

4417|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000005_000005.wav|6345|At last she fell asleep, and in a moment was dreaming diligently.
4418|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000012_000000.wav|6345|But the dead, one of them seized one of her hands, and another the other.

4420|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000010_000000.wav|6345|Then came the form of her mother, and bent over that of her brother from behind.
4421|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000007_000002.wav|6345|At the end of it she was in a place of tombs.
4422|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000005_000002.wav|6345|The loss, the evanishment, the ceasing, were incontrovertible-the only incontrovertible things: she was sure of them: could she be sure of anything else?
4423|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000008.wav|6345|It is nothing.
4424|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000003_000000.wav|6345|That night, and every night until the dust was laid to the dust, Mary slept well; and through the days she had great composure; but, when the funeral was over, came a collapse and a change.
4425|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000004_000006.wav|6345|If for a moment a thing looked the same as before, she wondered vaguely, unconsciously, how it could be.
4426|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000014_000000.wav|6345|Of a sudden a great splendor burst upon her, and through her eyelids she was struck blind-blind with light and not with darkness, for all was radiance about her.
4427|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000012_000003.wav|6345|Through the moonlight they led her from the city, and over fields, and through valleys, and across rivers and seas-a long journey; nor did she grow weary, for there was not life enough in her to be made weary.
4428|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000007_000003.wav|6345|Terror and a dismay indescribable seized her; she turned and fled back to the company of her kind.
4429|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000007_000004.wav|6345|But for a long time she sought the house in vain; she could not reach it; the avenue seemed interminable to her feet returning.
4430|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000010_000005.wav|6345|Oh, cold creatures, ye are not what ye seem, and I will none of you!"
4431|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000005_000001.wav|6345|Death was a fact.
4432|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000016_000002.wav|6345|And the voice said, "Poor child! something has closed the valve between her heart and mine." With that came a pang of intense pain.
4433|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000011.wav|6345|Everything is an empty dream of loss.
4434|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000012_000004.wav|6345|The dead never spoke to her, and she never spoke to them.
4435|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000008_000008.wav|6345|It was all deadness.
4436|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000014_000001.wav|6345|She was like a fish in a sea of light.
4437|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000003.wav|6345|He came to her side, and she gave him no greeting.
4438|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000012_000002.wav|6345|Thus was she borne away captive of her dead, neither willing nor unwilling, of life and death equally careless.
4439|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000005_000003.wav|6345|How could she? She had not seen Christ rise; she had never looked upon one of the dead; never heard a voice from the other bank; had received no certain testimony.
4440|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000006_000004.wav|6345|Every now and then she came on a little group, or met a party of the guests, as she walked, but none spoke to her, or seemed to see her, and she spoke to none.
4441|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000004_000000.wav|6345|That night was the first herald of the coming winter, and blew a cold blast from his horn.
4442|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000002.wav|6345|But not a throb went through her heart.
4443|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000006_000000.wav|6345|She was one of a large company at a house where she had never been before-a beautiful house with a large garden behind.

4445|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000007_000000.wav|6345|She found herself at length in an avenue of dark trees, the end of which was far off.
4446|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000014.wav|6345|The old time was but a thicker dream, and this is truer because more shadowy." And, the form still standing by her, she felt it was ages away; she was divided from it by a gulf of very nothingness.
4447|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000008_000001.wav|6345|No carriage rolled along the center, no footfarer walked on the side.
4448|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000010_000003.wav|6345|If I speak to her, she is not there.
4449|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000004_000004.wav|6345|The smell of the linen, of the blue cloth, and of the brown paper-things no longer to be handled by those tender, faithful hands-was dismal and strange, and haunted her like things that intruded, things which she had done with, and which yet would not go away.
4450|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000005.wav|6345|"He is dead.
4451|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000016.wav|6345|Her whole consciousness was merest, all but abstract, loss.
4452|dev-clean/6345/64257/6345_64257_000009_000015.wav|6345|Her only life was, that she was lost.
4453|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000000.wav|6345|He had asked her to meet him at Cannon Street; he had something to say to her, and at home it was difficult to get a quiet half hour because of her little sisters.
4454|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000001.wav|6345|Some great sorrow had come to him.
4455|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000045_000000.wav|6345|"Of course, if you like," he said uncomfortably; yet she could see he was glad that she had broken that desolate silence.
4456|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000053_000000.wav|6345|It was on the tip of her tongue to say that she would stand by him whatever he had done; but if he had married someone else this would be improper, so she only said, "Well?" and she said it coldly.
4457|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000043_000002.wav|6345|She stole a glance at him, and for the first time it occurred to her that his "something to say" was not a mere excuse for being alone with her. He had something to say-something that was trying to get itself said. The keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket. Her hands and feet were aching with cold.
4458|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000013.wav|6345|Yet perhaps, after all, that is not because of the literary sense. It may be because she loved him.
4459|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000049_000000.wav|6345|The fine tact of a noble woman seemed to have deserted her.
4460|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000064_000000.wav|6345|"Forgive me, dear," he said.
4461|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000006.wav|6345|Well, it was not too late.
4462|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000039_000002.wav|6345|So she said-
4463|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000001.wav|6345|And, curiously enough, she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say.
4464|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000042_000003.wav|6345|Then he would have had to say something.
4465|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000073_000000.wav|6345|So she said-
4466|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000004.wav|6345|She almost said, "Never mind, dear.
4467|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000002.wav|6345|She would have liked to meet him in some green, cool orchard, where daffodils swung in the long grass, and primroses stood on frail stiff little pink stalks in the wet, scented moss of the hedgerow.
4468|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000066_000000.wav|6345|"Do you think I'm not sorry now?"
4469|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000065_000001.wav|6345|"Never," she said, her eyes flashing through her tears.
4470|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000070_000001.wav|6345|"Do you mean it?" he said, and his tone should have warned her.
4471|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000055_000000.wav|6345|"Well?" she said.
4472|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000000.wav|6345|He stood up suddenly.
4473|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000058_000000.wav|6345|Following the tingle of relief came a sharp, sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification.
4474|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000003.wav|6345|What was it, compared with her fears?
4475|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000042_000001.wav|6345|She had done the proper thing; she had awaited these with dignified reserve, and now she was involved in the meshes of a silence that she could not break. How easy it would have been in the orchard!
4476|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000071_000000.wav|6345|The anger in his eyes frightened her, and the misery of his face wrung her heart; but how could she say-
4477|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000001.wav|6345|And the fact that she was to meet him at Cannon Street Station would almost, she feared, make the meeting itself banal, sordid.
4478|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000047_000000.wav|6345|"How frightfully cold it is!"
4479|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000000.wav|6345|SHE was going to meet her lover.
4480|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000011.wav|6345|When she did her words did not fit the mouth of the girl in the orchard-but then it would have been May there, and this was January.
4481|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000062_000000.wav|6345|"Couldn't help it?
4482|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000002.wav|6345|She only wished for May and the orchard, instead of January and the dingy, dusty waiting room, the plain faced, preoccupied travellers, the dim, desolate weather.
4483|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000006.wav|6345|You see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals.
4484|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000000.wav|6345|Seated at a marble table-the place was nearly empty-she furtively watched his face in the glass, and what she saw there thrilled her.
4485|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000054_000003.wav|6345|I haven't answered her letter."
4486|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000062_000003.wav|6345|No-it's no use-I can never, never forgive you-and it's all over.
4487|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000003.wav|6345|The girl in the orchard would have known at a glance.
4488|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000044_000000.wav|6345|"I'm freezing," she said suddenly; "let's go and have some tea."
4489|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000052_000001.wav|6345|What had he done-a murder-a bank robbery-married someone else?
4490|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000043_000000.wav|6345|Why on earth didn't he speak?
4491|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000058_000001.wav|6345|These inspired her.
4492|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000059_000001.wav|6345|"You don't love me-you've never loved me-I was an idiot to believe you did."
4493|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000002.wav|6345|And she had been sulking!
4494|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000042_000005.wav|6345|And how common and mean that would be compared with the blossoming bough; and besides, the shops they were passing had nothing in the windows except cheap pastry and models of steam engines.
4495|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000065_000003.wav|6345|No, it's all over-you've broken my heart and destroyed my faith in human nature. I hope I shall never see you again.
4496|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000005.wav|6345|Her hands should have been full of bluebells, and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms.
4497|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000050_000001.wav|6345|As soon as the two were alone again he leaned his elbows on the marble and spoke.
4498|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000041_000000.wav|6345|They did not speak again till they had gone through the little back streets, past the police station and the mustard factory, and were on the broad pavement of Queen Victoria Street.
4499|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000042_000002.wav|6345|She could have snapped off a blossoming branch and-and made play with it somehow.
4500|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000007.wav|6345|She could begin now.
4501|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000004.wav|6345|"Go home and gloat over it all!
4502|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000006.wav|6345|He checked the silly impulse.
4503|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000052_000000.wav|6345|This preamble sent a shiver of dread down her spine.
4504|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000010.wav|6345|Yet she must speak.
4505|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000011.wav|6345|Because Destiny is almost without the literary sense, and Destiny carelessly decreed that he should die of enteric in a wretched hut, without so much as hearing a gun fired.
4506|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000006.wav|6345|This really was a master stroke of nobility.
4507|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000043_000001.wav|6345|He had never been like this before.
4508|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000010.wav|6345|How should she know that he had only told her because he feared that she would anyhow hear it through the indiscretion of the girl in pink, or of that other girl in blue who had seen and smiled?
4509|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000011.wav|6345|How could she guess that he had tuned his confession to the key of what he believed would be an innocent girl's estimate of his misconduct?
4510|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000002.wav|6345|It was a very good exit.
4511|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000074_000000.wav|6345|"Yes.
4512|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000006.wav|6345|He would hardly have known her in green and white muslin and an orchard, for their love had been born and bred in town-Highbury New Park, to be exact.
4513|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000008.wav|6345|But how?
4514|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000002.wav|6345|There's no more to be said; you've betrayed me.
4515|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000008.wav|6345|He had told her of the thing as one tells of a crime.
4516|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000007.wav|6345|He came towards her; he was five minutes late.
4517|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000008.wav|6345|She had grown anxious, as the one who waits always does, and she was extremely glad to see him, but she knew that a late lover should be treated with a provoking coldness (one can relent prettily later on), so she gave him a limp hand and no greeting.
4518|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000060_000000.wav|6345|"You know I do," he said; "it was hateful of me-but I couldn't help it."
4519|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000003.wav|6345|I didn't think a decent man could do such things." She was pulling on her gloves.
4520|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000042_000004.wav|6345|But here-the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at.
4521|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000005.wav|6345|But how could he go back to say, "We are parting for ever; but still, I must insist on the sad pleasure of paying for our tea-for the last time"?
4522|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000074_000001.wav|6345|Good bye!"
4523|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000003.wav|6345|At the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea, and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error.
4524|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000051_000000.wav|6345|"Look here, darling, I've got something to tell you, and I hope to God you'll forgive me and stand by me, and try to understand that I love you just the same, and whatever happens I shall always love you."
4525|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000068_000000.wav|6345|He would come to morrow, however, and then- At present the thing to compass was a dignified parting.
4526|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000001.wav|6345|And it's good bye for ever. No-it's only painful for both of us.
4527|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000043_000003.wav|6345|How warm it would have been in the orchard!
4528|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000003.wav|6345|The time should have been May.
4529|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000040_000000.wav|6345|"Oh, the Embankment, please!" and felt a sting of annoyance and disappointment when he acquiesced.
4530|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000046_000005.wav|6345|She would have shared his sorrow, and shown herself "half wife, half angel from heaven" in this dark hour.
4531|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000049_000003.wav|6345|I can't bear to see you looking so miserable," and there was another silence.
4532|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000048_000000.wav|6345|"Yes, isn't it?" he said.
4533|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000069_000000.wav|6345|"Good bye," she said; "I'm going home.
4534|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000008.wav|6345|So she waited for him in vain, and at last paid for the tea herself, and went home to wait there-and there, too, in vain, for he never came back to her.
4535|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000072_000001.wav|6345|I'm only talking as I know good girls ought to talk"?
4536|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000004.wav|6345|She herself should have been a poem-a lyric in a white gown and green scarf, coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed boughs.
4537|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000062_000002.wav|6345|Even if we were married I could never be sure you weren't kissing some horrid girl or other.
4538|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000006.wav|6345|What opinion would he form of the purity of her mind, the innocence of her soul, if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply?
4539|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000038_000000.wav|6345|"Let's go out," he said.
4540|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000037_000004.wav|6345|Her dress was brown, her jacket black, and her hat was home trimmed.
4541|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000038_000001.wav|6345|"Shall we walk along the Embankment, or go somewhere on the Underground?"
4542|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000063_000000.wav|6345|He could not say, "And so I am, on the whole," which was what he thought.
4543|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000036_000007.wav|6345|She had, to the full limit allowed of her reading and her environment, the literary sense.
4544|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000065_000000.wav|6345|Then she rose to the occasion.
4545|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000063_000001.wav|6345|Her tears were falling hot and fast between face and veil, for she had talked till she was very sorry indeed for herself.
4546|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000070_000002.wav|6345|"Are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this?"
4547|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000067_000001.wav|6345|At home she could at least have buried her face in the sofa cushions and resisted all his pleading,--at last, perhaps, letting him take one cold passive hand and shower frantic kisses upon it.

4551|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000009.wav|6345|As the confession of a crime she must receive it.
4552|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000057_000000.wav|6345|She drew a deep breath.

4556|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000070_000000.wav|6345|He stood up suddenly.

4566|dev-clean/6345/93302/6345_93302_000075_000001.wav|6345|"Then good bye," he said, "and may God forgive you as I do!" And he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door.

4571|dev-clean/3853/163249/3853_163249_000122_000000.wav|3853|"Glad and proud to do it." "With no doubt, no fear, to mar your consent." "Not one, David." "That's true love, Christie!"

4889|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000018_000002.wav|2277|"You'd better look in those big manufacturing houses along Franklin Street and just the other side of the river," he concluded. "Lots of girls work there.
4890|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000016_000000.wav|2277|"Well," she said, "I think I'll look around to morrow.
4891|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000010_000000.wav|2277|In the interval which marked the preparation of the meal Carrie found time to study the flat.
4892|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000015_000001.wav|2277|He seemed to be thinking of something else.
4893|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000030_000005.wav|2277|She was pleased to see her in a way, but reflected her husband's point of view in the matter of work.
4894|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000028_000000.wav|2277|"I cannot have you call on me here.

4896|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000014_000001.wav|2277|"Well, we'll go out Sunday and see Lincoln Park."
4897|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000029_000000.wav|2277|She troubled herself over what else to put in the letter.
4898|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000010_000001.wav|2277|She had some slight gift of observation and that sense, so rich in every woman-intuition.
4899|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000006_000001.wav|2277|It was on the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing.
4900|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000030_000006.wav|2277|Anything was good enough so long as it paid-say, five dollars a week to begin with.
4901|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000025_000003.wav|2277|If Hanson sat every evening in the front room and read his paper, if he went to bed at nine, and Minnie a little later, what would they expect of her?
4902|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000007_000005.wav|2277|His one observation to the point was concerning the chances of work in Chicago.
4903|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000033_000003.wav|2277|These vast buildings, what were they?
4904|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000030_000007.wav|2277|A shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer.

4906|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000007_000001.wav|2277|Her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper.
4907|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000030_000008.wav|2277|She would get in one of the great shops and do well enough until-well, until something happened. Neither of them knew exactly what.
4908|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000026_000000.wav|2277|"No," she said to herself, "he can't come here."
4909|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000008_000000.wav|2277|"It's a big place," he said.
4910|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000020_000000.wav|2277|"I've got to get up early in the morning, so I'll go to bed," and off he went, disappearing into the dark little bedroom off the hall, for the night.
4911|dev-clean/2277/149874/2277_149874_000025_000002.wav|2277|She read from the manner of Hanson, in the subdued air of Minnie, and, indeed, the whole atmosphere of the flat, a settled opposition to anything save a conservative round of toil.
4912|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000011_000000.wav|2277|"You take this to this address," he said, handing him the envelope, "and give it to mrs Hurstwood."
4913|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000017_000001.wav|2277|Hurry right back."
4914|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000003.wav|2277|He thought he would go out and insist on seeing her if she did not send him word of some sort soon.
4915|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000052_000001.wav|2277|If he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly.
4916|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000003.wav|2277|He was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it.
4917|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000032_000002.wav|2277|Meanwhile, he would have time to think.
4918|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000000.wav|2277|The boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings.
4919|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000005.wav|2277|He could see her meeting the boy at the door and smiling sardonically.
4920|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000010.wav|2277|It wasn't possible.
4921|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000030_000000.wav|2277|There was no more to be done upon that score that night.
4922|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000039_000000.wav|2277|Then he folded it up and put it in his pocket.
4923|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000029_000000.wav|2277|Hurstwood scowled fiercely.
4924|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000001.wav|2277|He was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy.
4925|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000021_000001.wav|2277|He tried to get the interest of things about him, but it was not to be.
4926|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000046_000000.wav|2277|That night he dined at Rector's and returned at once to his office.
4927|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000004.wav|2277|He was really affected most miserably of all by this desertion.
4928|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000028_000000.wav|2277|"She said it was high time."
4929|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000009.wav|2277|He would go to her and tell her all his family complications. He would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her. Surely she couldn't go back on him now?
4930|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000033_000001.wav|2277|How about that now?
4931|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000031_000002.wav|2277|Nothing from his wife, which was pleasant.
4932|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000052_000000.wav|2277|So here it was spread out clear before him, and now he knew what to expect.
4933|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000002.wav|2277|Every once in a while he would clinch his fingers and tap his foot-signs of the stirring mental process he was undergoing.
4934|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000047_000000.wav|2277|On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, james and Hay.
4935|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000012_000000.wav|2277|"Yes, sir," said the boy.
4936|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000004_000000.wav|2277|CHAPTER twenty five
4937|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000032_000000.wav|2277|The fact that he had sent the money and that she had received it worked to the ease of his mind, for, as the thought that he had done it receded, his chagrin at it grew less and his hope of peace more.
4938|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000013_000000.wav|2277|"If she isn't there bring it back."
4939|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000005.wav|2277|He got back to his office and joined in a conversation with friends.
4940|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000008.wav|2277|He breathed heavily and wiped the moisture from his face.
4941|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000017_000000.wav|2277|"All right, now.
4942|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000035_000000.wav|2277|The hours slipped by, and with them the possibility of the union he had contemplated.
4943|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000046_000002.wav|2277|He troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody.
4944|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000011.wav|2277|He would plead until her anger would melt-until she would forgive him.
4945|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000014_000000.wav|2277|"Yes, sir."
4946|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000001.wav|2277|Now he had done it.
4947|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000004.wav|2277|He drank more brandy and soda than he had any evening in months.
4948|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000000.wav|2277|One of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came back on a Randolph Street car, and without noticing arrived almost opposite the building of the concern with which his son was connected.
4949|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000001.wav|2277|What could be the trouble in that quarter?
4950|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000015_000000.wav|2277|"You've seen my wife?" he asked as a precautionary measure as the boy turned to go.
4951|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000022_000001.wav|2277|He had evidently delivered the package, for, as he came up, he made no sign of taking anything out of his pocket.

4953|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000004.wav|2277|He saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score.
4954|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000041_000000.wav|2277|Suddenly he thought: "Supposing she isn't out there-suppose she has gone?"
4955|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000052_000002.wav|2277|If he did, he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil.
4956|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000019_000000.wav|2277|"I guess not."
4957|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000046_000001.wav|2277|In the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief.
4958|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000004.wav|2277|But, oh, the wretchedness of being forced this way!
4959|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000004.wav|2277|Well, well, fortune plays a man queer tricks.
4960|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000005.wav|2277|He had loved her earnestly enough, but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive.
4961|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000006.wav|2277|She would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed.
4962|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000005.wav|2277|He was desperately in love, and would have taken great chances to win her under ordinary circumstances, but now-now what? Supposing she had found out something?
4963|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000027_000000.wav|2277|"Any answer?"
4964|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000023_000000.wav|2277|"Well?" said Hurstwood.
4965|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000035_000002.wav|2277|Three o'clock came, four, five, six, and no letter.
4966|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000003.wav|2277|He could hardly realise how it had all come about.
4967|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000042_000001.wav|2277|It was too much to think of and sit still.
4968|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000002.wav|2277|How could things have taken such a violent turn, and so quickly?
4969|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000007.wav|2277|It would be just like this to happen as things were going now. Meanwhile he had not sent the money.
4970|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000049_000000.wav|2277|"Very truly yours, etc"
4971|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000000.wav|2277|He strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort, his hands in his pockets, his brow wrinkled, his mouth set.
4972|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000005.wav|2277|He was altogether a fine example of great mental perturbation.
4973|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000046_000003.wav|2277|He stayed at his desk long after all others had gone, and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked.
4974|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000009_000000.wav|2277|For all his study nothing came of the evening except this-he sent the money.
4975|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000001.wav|2277|Lord, Lord, he thought, what had he got into?
4976|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000044_000002.wav|2277|He did not go within a block of the house.
4977|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000047_000001.wav|2277|It read:
4978|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000006.wav|2277|He really pined for a word, and looked out upon her with his mind's eye in the most wistful manner.
4979|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000037_000001.wav|2277|It seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning.
4980|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000044_000001.wav|2277|He did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to Carrie, but when he got in Ogden Place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away.
4981|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000018_000000.wav|2277|"Any answer?"
4982|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000037_000000.wav|2277|He read it through carefully several times, and then merely shook his head.
4983|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000016_000001.wav|2277|I know her."
4984|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000035_000004.wav|2277|It was the worst Sunday he had spent in his life.
4985|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000000.wav|2277|When Hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever.
4986|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000033_000004.wav|2277|The thought that this letter would probably not reach her until Monday chafed him exceedingly.
4987|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000031_000001.wav|2277|No word from Carrie.
4988|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000052_000003.wav|2277|He folded the letter and put it with the other one.
4989|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000008_000001.wav|2277|He was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar, but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him.
4990|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000025_000000.wav|2277|"My wife?"
4991|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000001.wav|2277|This sent a pang through his heart.
4992|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000045_000003.wav|2277|His absence did not seem to be noticed by either of his children.
4993|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000000.wav|2277|Meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to Carrie.
4994|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000038_000000.wav|2277|"Well!" he said after a time, quite audibly, "I don't know."
4995|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000009_000001.wav|2277|It was with great opposition, after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial, that at last he got an envelope, placed in it the requested amount, and slowly sealed it up.
4996|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000043_000000.wav|2277|Nevertheless, his rousing availed him nothing.
4997|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000000.wav|2277|To add to his misery there was no word from Carrie.
4998|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000050_000000.wav|2277|"Compromise!" exclaimed Hurstwood bitterly.
4999|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000042_000000.wav|2277|He was forced to take his feet.
5000|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000033_000005.wav|2277|He must get some speedier method-but how?
5001|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000007_000002.wav|2277|No letter had come, no word of any kind, and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning.
5002|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000008.wav|2277|Come what might, he would adjust this matter, and soon.
5003|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000031_000000.wav|2277|Next day he went again to the office and opened his mail, suspicious and hopeful of its contents.
5004|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000040_000007.wav|2277|He did not propose to lose her, whatever she might think.
5005|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000016_000000.wav|2277|"Oh, yes, sir.
5006|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000020_000002.wav|2277|There was no use speculating over that.
5007|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000033_000003.wav|2277|He decided to write her care of the West Side Post office and ask for an explanation, as well as to have her meet him.
5008|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000026_000000.wav|2277|"Yes, sir."
5009|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000006_000004.wav|2277|It seemed a monstrous, unnatural, unwarranted condition which had suddenly descended upon him without his let or hindrance.
5010|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000030_000002.wav|2277|He wondered what the morning would bring forth, and slept anything but soundly upon it.
5011|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000032_000001.wav|2277|He fancied, as he sat at his desk, that nothing would be done for a week or two.
5012|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000024_000000.wav|2277|"I gave it to her."
5013|dev-clean/2277/149897/2277_149897_000022_000000.wav|2277|In about an hour and three quarters the boy returned.
5014|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000007_000003.wav|2277|He could arrange that satisfactorily, for Carrie would be glad to wait, if necessary.
5015|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000008.wav|2277|He jangled it fiercely several times in succession, but without avail.
5016|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000006.wav|2277|He rang again-this time harder.
5017|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000002_000005.wav|2277|He walked the floor of his little office, and later that of his room, putting one thing and another together to no avail.
5018|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000000.wav|2277|By the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself, that he could see his way out.
5019|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000015_000001.wav|2277|I need it to carry out my plans.
5020|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000009_000007.wav|2277|She had not been able to get away this morning.
5021|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000004_000003.wav|2277|Curse it!
5022|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000007_000007.wav|2277|How much more pleasant it would be.
5023|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000009_000003.wav|2277|Could she have been reached by his wife?
5024|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000012_000001.wav|2277|He looked at the little chap with a feeling of doubt.
5025|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000011_000002.wav|2277|He walked the floor again, pretending to be in an ordinary mood, but secretly troubled beyond the expression of words.
5026|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000030_000000.wav|2277|So this was the game, was it?
5027|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000009_000000.wav|2277|His spirits fell, however, when, upon reaching the park, he waited and waited and Carrie did not come.
5028|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000008.wav|2277|He would go up there and have it out with her, that's what he would do.
5029|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000004_000002.wav|2277|"What a fool trick that was.
5030|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000002_000002.wav|2277|While he was not sure how much significance might be attached to the threat she had made, he was sure that her attitude, if long continued, would cause him no end of trouble.
5031|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000019_000000.wav|2277|He arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street.
5032|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000007_000006.wav|2277|He saw only her pretty face and neat figure and wondered why life was not arranged so that such joy as he found with her could be steadily maintained.
5033|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000002_000003.wav|2277|She was determined, and had worsted him in a very important contest.
5034|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000001_000000.wav|2277|ASHES OF TINDER: A FACE AT THE WINDOW
5035|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000024_000000.wav|2277|He began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other-that he had sent the money.
5036|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000010_000000.wav|2277|After a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the Madison car. To add to his distress, the bright blue sky became overcast with little fleecy clouds which shut out the sun
5037|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000017_000000.wav|2277|Later, however, his old discretion asserted itself.
5038|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000004_000000.wav|2277|Hurstwood walked the floor, mentally arranging the chief points of his situation.
5039|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000010.wav|2277|These were his first thoughts.
5040|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000004.wav|2277|Then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing, contemplating the result of his work.
5041|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000022_000000.wav|2277|He put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella.
5042|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000019_000002.wav|2277|Pedestrians had turned up collars, and trousers at the bottom.
5043|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000005.wav|2277|No answer.
5044|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000002.wav|2277|He pulled out his key and tried to insert it, but another key was on the inside.
5045|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000002_000001.wav|2277|He was in a fevered state of mind, owing to the blight his wife's action threatened to cast upon his entire future.
5046|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000026_000001.wav|2277|What could it mean?
5047|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000030_000001.wav|2277|Shut him out and make him pay.
5048|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000009.wav|2277|She was carrying things with too high a hand.
5049|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000018_000001.wav|2277|I'll make her change her tone if I have to use force to do it!"
5050|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000008_000002.wav|2277|He began to feel the appetite that had been wanting before he had reached the office, and decided before going out to the park to meet Carrie to drop in at the Grand Pacific and have a pot of coffee and some rolls.
5051|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000026_000002.wav|2277|He rang the bell and then waited.
5052|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000014_000000.wav|2277|Hurstwood recognised his wife's writing.
5053|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000015_000005.wav|2277|So don't delay, but send it by the boy."
5054|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000018_000000.wav|2277|"Damn her!" he said softly, with his teeth firmly set, "I'll make it hot for her if she causes me trouble.
5055|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000005_000005.wav|2277|He would have to explain and deny and make a general mark of himself.
5056|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000028_000000.wav|2277|"I saw a young girl up in that winder," returned the cabby.
5057|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000005_000000.wav|2277|He also thought of his managerial position.
5058|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000005_000003.wav|2277|My friends, too!" He grew more angry as he thought of the talk any action on her part would create.
5059|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000007_000008.wav|2277|Then he would take up his wife's threat again, and the wrinkles and moisture would return.
5060|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000003_000006.wav|2277|She would find out at once just what advantages she could gain.
5061|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000004_000004.wav|2277|What a fool move that was."
5062|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000011_000000.wav|2277|He went in and examined his letters, but there was nothing from Carrie. Fortunately, there was nothing from his wife either.
5063|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000024_000001.wav|2277|Perhaps he could do it up here.
5064|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000009_000002.wav|2277|Could something have happened out there to keep her away?
5065|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000006.wav|2277|The confounded wretch!
5066|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000003_000002.wav|2277|He would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble.
5067|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000001.wav|2277|The audacity of the thing took his breath.
5068|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000006_000001.wav|2277|He saw no solution of anything-not a loophole left.
5069|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000013_000000.wav|2277|"I'm to bring an answer," said the boy.
5070|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000003.wav|2277|His first impulse was to write but four words in reply-"Go to the devil!"--but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply.
5071|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000003_000001.wav|2277|Now that she had practically cowed him, she would follow up her work with demands, the acknowledgment of which would make her word law in the future.
5072|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000003.wav|2277|He shook at the knob, but the door was locked.
5073|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000029_000000.wav|2277|Hurstwood looked, but there was no face there now.
5074|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000011_000001.wav|2277|He thanked his stars that he did not have to confront that proposition just now when he needed to think so much.
5075|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000025_000001.wav|2277|He alighted and went up the steps to the front door, but it was with a nervous palpitation of the heart.
5076|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000021_000001.wav|2277|He'd take it to her-he would go up there and have a talk with her, and that at once.
5077|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000014_000001.wav|2277|He tore it open and read without a show of feeling.
5078|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000008_000004.wav|2277|If he could only get plenty of time to think, perhaps something would turn up.
5079|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000026_000003.wav|2277|Finally, seeing that no one was coming, he turned and went back to his cab.
5080|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000005.wav|2277|What would she do about that?
5081|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000024_000003.wav|2277|He would have no row.
5082|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000023_000001.wav|2277|On the way his temper cooled as he thought of the details of the case.
5083|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000019_000003.wav|2277|Hands were hidden in the pockets of the umbrellaless; umbrellas were up.
5084|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000017_000003.wav|2277|He knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up.
5085|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000019_000004.wav|2277|The street looked like a sea of round black cloth roofs, twisting, bobbing, moving.
5086|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000016_000002.wav|2277|It roused his ire also-the deepest element of revolt in him.
5087|dev-clean/2277/149896/2277_149896_000019_000006.wav|2277|He scarcely noticed the picture.

5110|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000049_000000.wav|251|From a pay telephone, he called Swift Enterprises in Shopton.
5111|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000064_000002.wav|251|"Male or female? Human or animal?"
5112|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000053_000000.wav|251|mrs Swift, a slender, petite woman, tried not to show concern when she saw the boys, bruised and disheveled.
5113|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000015_000002.wav|251|"The roof! It's caving in!" he heard someone scream.
5114|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000049_000003.wav|251|He also called home and spoke to his sister, Sandra.

5116|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000050_000000.wav|251|"What a relief!" Sandy gasped.
5117|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000037_000001.wav|251|"There would've been a lot more casualties."
5118|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000019_000000.wav|251|"Good night!" Tom's eyes focused in horror on the wreckage enveloped by still billowing dust.
5119|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000038_000001.wav|251|"Right where we landed our Whirling Duck!"
5120|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000032_000001.wav|251|"We'd better not try to move him," Tom decided.
5121|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000042_000001.wav|251|"Why not send a car?
5122|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000059_000001.wav|251|While they ate, mr Swift managed after some difficulty to get a call through to the Harkness Hospital. His face was grave as he hung up.
5123|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000038_000000.wav|251|"Look!" Tom pointed to a huge crevasse.
5124|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000044_000001.wav|251|"Anyhow, we want to help.
5125|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000031_000001.wav|251|Bud seized a slender, steel I beam and managed to pry up the wreckage while Tom carefully extricated mr Faber.
5126|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000017_000000.wav|251|Bud threw up his arms to protect himself, but too late!

5128|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000025_000002.wav|251|"If that beam had landed square on your noggin, even a rock head like you couldn't have survived!"
5129|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000056_000001.wav|251|"Why did you have to go and spoil it?" he complained jokingly.
5130|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000055_000000.wav|251|Tom laughed.
5131|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000064_000000.wav|251|Both boys were amazed and excited.
5132|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000062_000000.wav|251|"A visitor?" Tom looked at his father.
5133|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000044_000002.wav|251|Got a job for us?"
5134|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000021_000000.wav|251|Suddenly Tom stiffened in fear.
5135|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000046_000000.wav|251|The telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from Harkness-fire trucks, three ambulances, and private cars driven by volunteers.
5136|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000012_000002.wav|251|Before he reached it, another shock knocked all of them off their feet.
5137|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000028_000001.wav|251|He had heard about the great San Francisco earthquake from his grandfather, and had no doubt about the nature of the tremors.
5138|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000059_000000.wav|251|After the two boys had showered and changed their clothes, mrs Swift served them a delicious, hot meal.
5139|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000022_000000.wav|251|Disregarding his own injuries, Tom hastily freed himself from the debris and groped his way to Bud's side.
5140|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000033_000002.wav|251|Then Tom taped a bandage on Bud's scalp wound.
5141|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000011_000000.wav|251|"Look out!
5142|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000049_000002.wav|251|Tom asked the operator to send a helicopter immediately to pick them up.
5143|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000045_000001.wav|251|Within minutes, Tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings. Bud organized a fire fighting crew to keep the blaze in the shed from spreading.
5144|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000024_000003.wav|251|What hit me?"
5145|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000023_000000.wav|251|"Are you all right?" Tom asked fearfully.
5146|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000002_000001.wav|251|"Hope you can find out what's wrong."
5147|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000008_000000.wav|251|"Good grief!" Bud exclaimed.
5148|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000056_000002.wav|251|"I was all set for Sandy's cool soothing touch on my fevered brow!"
5149|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000035_000000.wav|251|"Right!" Bud responded.
5150|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000052_000000.wav|251|The helicopter arrived within twenty minutes at the place Tom had named. After landing at Enterprises, the boys drove to the pleasant, tree shaded Swift home on the outskirts of town.
5151|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000055_000002.wav|251|"Why, one of the ambulance doctors checked us out."
5152|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000022_000001.wav|251|With a desperate heave, he shoved the beam away, then cradled Bud's head in his arm.
5153|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000005_000001.wav|251|Inside, a secret rocket telemetering device was mounted on its test stand.
5154|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000047_000000.wav|251|Two hours later there was nothing more Tom and Bud could do at the disaster scene and they hitched a ride into Harkness.
5155|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000008_000001.wav|251|"This isn't part of your testing routine, is it?"
5156|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000033_000000.wav|251|Of the four other company engineers, two were now stirring and partly conscious.
5157|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000051_000001.wav|251|Tell Mother and Dad that we're okay," Tom said. "We'll be home in a jiffy-with big appetites!"
5158|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000036_000000.wav|251|They picked their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction.
5159|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000004_000000.wav|251|Bud Barclay, a dark haired young flier and Tom Swift Jr's closest friend, chuckled.
5160|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000044_000000.wav|251|"Tough break," Tom sympathized.
5161|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000032_000000.wav|251|The scientist seemed to be badly injured.
5162|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000040_000002.wav|251|Let's see about getting help for mr Faber!"
5163|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000013_000000.wav|251|Electronic equipment cascaded from the wall shelves, and a heavy duty chain hoist came loose from its overhead track, plunging to the floor with a terrifying crash.
5164|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000033_000001.wav|251|The boys found a first aid cabinet and gave what help they could to them and the other two men.
5165|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000041_000000.wav|251|Despite the chaotic confusion, the boys managed to locate the plant superintendent-a harried, middle aged man named Simkins-who was doing his best to restore order.
5166|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000047_000001.wav|251|The town had suffered some damage, though only slight compared to the destruction at the plant.
5167|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000053_000001.wav|251|"I'm so thankful you're both safe!" she murmured.
5168|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000007_000000.wav|251|He broke off with a gasp of astonishment as the whole building suddenly began to shake.
5169|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000034_000000.wav|251|"Let's see if we can find a telephone and call the local hospital," Tom said.
5170|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000051_000000.wav|251|"Don't worry, Sis.
5171|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000061_000000.wav|251|Tom nodded unhappily.
5172|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000060_000002.wav|251|He's a great scientist."
5173|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000024_000000.wav|251|The answer came in a groan.
5174|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000054_000002.wav|251|The two girls were as much upset as Tom's mother.
5175|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000030_000000.wav|251|"mr Faber!" he gasped.
5176|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000060_000001.wav|251|"A pity.
5177|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000027_000000.wav|251|Somewhat shakily, Bud got to his feet with Tom's assistance.
5178|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000065_000001.wav|251|"None of those," he replied as the boys stared, mystified.
5179|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000018_000000.wav|251|For minutes, no one stirred among the wreckage.
5180|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000040_000000.wav|251|"No use fussing about it now," Tom said.
5181|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000002_000000.wav|251|"Tom, we're having a problem with the gyro stabilizer," said Mark Faber, gray haired president of the Faber Electronics Company.
5182|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000017_000001.wav|251|A falling beam caught him on the back of the head and the young flier blacked out.
5183|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000018_000001.wav|251|Then Tom, who had been stunned by some falling debris, raised himself to a sitting position.
5184|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000025_000001.wav|251|Or grazed, at least," Tom added thankfully.
5185|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000063_000000.wav|251|"From another planet," mr Swift revealed.
5186|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000005_000000.wav|251|The two boys followed mr Faber and his engineers to a wooden building which was tightly guarded.
5187|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000012_000001.wav|251|Another engineer rushed toward the door to see what was happening outside.
5188|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000022_000002.wav|251|His friend's eyelids flickered.

5190|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000057_000001.wav|251|"I tried to assure them that you and Bud can take care of yourselves in any crisis." He smiled guiltily as he added, "But I must admit I was more than a little concerned myself."
5191|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000020_000001.wav|251|Only two thirds of the walls were still standing.
5192|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000036_000003.wav|251|Dazed and panic stricken survivors were wandering around aimlessly or rushing about to assist the injured.
5193|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000026_000001.wav|251|"We grow 'em tough out in California where I come from!" he joked.
5194|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000061_000001.wav|251|Sandy, to take her brother's mind off the disaster, said, "Dad, tell Tom and Bud about the visitor who's coming."
5195|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000006_000000.wav|251|"As you know, Tom," mr Faber began, "the usual conditions of rocket flight will be-"
5196|dev-clean/251/137823/251_137823_000031_000000.wav|251|The two boys scrambled through the clutter of debris toward the spot where the test stand had been erected.

5442|dev-clean/2803/154328/2803_154328_000061_000001.wav|2803|Lord and Lady Glenarvan first; when they arrive at the bottom, three pulls at the rope will be a signal to us to follow."
5443|dev-clean/2803/154328/2803_154328_000043_000001.wav|2803|Round his body was rolled a long coil of flax rope.

5445|dev-clean/2803/154328/2803_154328_000062_000000.wav|2803|"I will go first," said Robert.
