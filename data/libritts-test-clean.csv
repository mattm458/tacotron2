test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000006_000000.wav|4446|Just then they drove up to the Duke of York's, so Alexander did not commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre.

test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000019_000002.wav|4446|The fact is, she's feeling rather seedy, poor child.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000021_000002.wav|4446|For some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience.

test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000019_000004.wav|4446|A little attack of nerves, possibly."
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000005_000000.wav|4446|Mainhall laughed.

test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000003_000005.wav|4446|She's apt to grow a bit stale after a time.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000023_000000.wav|4446|"Of course," he reflected, "she always had that combination of something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000022_000003.wav|4446|Hilda had never replied to his letter.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000020_000000.wav|4446|He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: "You know Lord Westmere, of course,--the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000007_000006.wav|4446|She's really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy tale."

test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000023_000001.wav|4446|But I never thought she'd do anything.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000015_000009.wav|4446|He's another who's awfully keen about her.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000023_000002.wav|4446|She hadn't much ambition then, and she was too fond of trifles.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000024_000000.wav|4446|Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000015_000011.wav|4446|Sir Harry Towne, mr Bartley Alexander, the American engineer."
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000006_000002.wav|4446|As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander's attention to the stage.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000004_000001.wav|4446|"Why, I haven't heard of her for-years."
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000015_000007.wav|4446|Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: "She's an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that.

test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000023_000006.wav|4446|She was a daft, generous little thing.
test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000015_000008.wav|4446|Here comes Sir Harry Towne.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000033_000001.wav|4446|"Please tell me one thing, Bartley.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000003.wav|4446|I won't promise.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000001.wav|4446|"Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid of myself.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000025_000000.wav|4446|He looked at her and his haggard face softened.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000006.wav|4446|If I'd met you later, if I hadn't loved you so well-but that's all over, long ago.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000000.wav|4446|Alexander rose and shook himself angrily.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000014_000001.wav|4446|"I can't stand seeing you miserable."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000000.wav|4446|Hilda shivered and sat still.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000045_000000.wav|4446|Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000004.wav|4446|A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000006.wav|4446|"You want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people?

test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000007_000000.wav|4446|"There's something troubling you, Bartley.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000005.wav|4446|"You see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000000.wav|4446|Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000047_000000.wav|4446|She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000031_000000.wav|4446|She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000005_000000.wav|4446|"I got in about ten minutes ago.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000019_000000.wav|4446|"Always.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000045_000001.wav|4446|Hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000029_000000.wav|4446|Alexander groaned.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000003.wav|4446|You ask me to stay away from you because you want me!
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000036_000002.wav|4446|I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000004.wav|4446|What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000029_000002.wav|4446|We had only a few days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000008.wav|4446|"Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day!
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000006.wav|4446|I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have SOMETHING!"
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000033_000002.wav|4446|At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000033_000000.wav|4446|"Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000006.wav|4446|He stood his ground over by the windows until Hilda came in.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000019_000001.wav|4446|But it's worse now.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000027_000001.wav|4446|The first was-sort of in play, wasn't it?"
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000036_000001.wav|4446|I wanted you to eat all the cakes and have them, too.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000006.wav|4446|But, if you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000005.wav|4446|"You want me to say it?" she whispered.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000002.wav|4446|"It's got to be a clean break, Hilda.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000008_000002.wav|4446|You and i"
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000013_000002.wav|4446|She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with her hand, then sank back upon her stool.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000035_000000.wav|4446|She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:--
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000000.wav|4446|"No!" she gasped.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000007.wav|4446|The shamefulness of your asking me to do that!
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000012.wav|4446|But why do you let me chatter on like this?
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000002.wav|4446|I must see you.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000009.wav|4446|Do you understand?
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000031_000002.wav|4446|He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000032_000001.wav|4446|You know.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000025_000001.wav|4446|He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000023_000000.wav|4446|"Could you-could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?"
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000000.wav|4446|"I understand, Bartley.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000001_000001.wav|4446|The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000048_000000.wav|4446|"Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000002.wav|4446|I don't trust myself any more.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000031_000001.wav|4446|Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000004.wav|4446|And I've got nobody but you.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000001.wav|4446|I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000012_000000.wav|4446|"Everything!"
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000024_000002.wav|4446|I have thought about it until I am worn out."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000001.wav|4446|Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000008.wav|4446|And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000006_000000.wav|4446|Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000000.wav|4446|"Just something Bartley.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000002.wav|4446|"Each life spoils the other.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000016_000001.wav|4446|He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000019_000003.wav|4446|It tortures me every minute."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000007_000001.wav|4446|What is it?"
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000010.wav|4446|I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000006.wav|4446|I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here with you.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000020_000000.wav|4446|"But why NOW?" she asked piteously, wringing her hands.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000041_000000.wav|4446|Hilda sprang up like a flame.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000047_000001.wav|4446|Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000008_000000.wav|4446|Bartley bent lower over the fire.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000000.wav|4446|Emerging at Euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to Bedford Square.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000037_000000.wav|4446|Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000030_000000.wav|4446|"Yes, I was happy, wasn't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Weren't you happy then, at all?"
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000005.wav|4446|It's different now.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000041_000001.wav|4446|She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000004.wav|4446|The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful-can I never make you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000010_000000.wav|4446|"What about us, Bartley?" she asked in a thin voice.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000013.wav|4446|Come over to the fire; you're chilled through."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000011_000001.wav|4446|At last Alexander brought out one word:--
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000048_000002.wav|4446|Forget everything except that I am here."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000003.wav|4446|I must know about you.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000029_000001.wav|4446|"I meant to, but somehow I couldn't.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000003.wav|4446|I can't see you at all, anywhere.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000002.wav|4446|Why didn't you let me be angry with you?
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000022_000001.wav|4446|She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000004.wav|4446|The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000003.wav|4446|I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don't dare trifle with it.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000005_000001.wav|4446|I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000005.wav|4446|I will do anything you say-but that!
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000005.wav|4446|Keep away if you wish; when have I ever followed you?
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000009_000001.wav|4446|She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000004_000001.wav|4446|You haven't spoken a word."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000001_000000.wav|4446|The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000018_000000.wav|4446|"It . . . it hasn't always made you miserable, has it?" Her eyelids fell and her lips quivered.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000004.wav|4446|It's abominable of you to ask me.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000002.wav|4446|But I didn't know.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000003.wav|4446|The room was empty when he entered.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000006_000001.wav|4446|Hilda watched him with perplexity.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000019_000002.wav|4446|It's unbearable.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000008.wav|4446|If you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000009_000000.wav|4446|Hilda took a quick, soft breath.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000014_000000.wav|4446|"I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley," she said tremulously.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000004.wav|4446|It's getting the better of me.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000048_000001.wav|4446|"We've tortured each other enough for tonight.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000024_000000.wav|4446|He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000000.wav|4446|He ignored her question.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000027_000000.wav|4446|"After the very first.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000013_000000.wav|4446|Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000011.wav|4446|I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000007.wav|4446|I can do that."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000013_000001.wav|4446|She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000010.wav|4446|Bartley, you're cowardly!"
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000003_000000.wav|4446|She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000005.wav|4446|There is this deception between me and everything."
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000039_000000.wav|4446|"I can't," he said heavily.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000036_000000.wav|4446|"You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000009.wav|4446|I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000028_000000.wav|4446|Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000016_000000.wav|4446|He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000005.wav|4446|Alexander did not sit down.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000026_000000.wav|4446|She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000004.wav|4446|What must I do that I've not done, or what must I not do?" She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000003.wav|4446|You've only to tell me now.
test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000003.wav|4446|I get nothing but misery out of either.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000008_000002.wav|4446|I've no need for fine clothes in Mac's play this time, so I can afford a few duddies for myself.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000011_000003.wav|4446|He painted that group of cypresses for the Salon, and it was bought for the Luxembourg."
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000015_000000.wav|4446|Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: "I've a neat little sum in the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000035_000003.wav|4446|They went home sadly with the lilacs, back to the Rue Saint Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000016_000000.wav|4446|Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000003_000001.wav|4446|He had a long talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a discontented state of mind.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000035_000002.wav|4446|Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized that he was in love. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply, had frightened them both.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000019_000002.wav|4446|We always had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre-queer theatres, for that matter."
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000023_000001.wav|4446|"Oh, yes, I go over to Paris often.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000050_000003.wav|4446|Good night."
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000008_000003.wav|4446|It's owing to that same chance, by the way, that I am able to ask you to dinner.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000050_000001.wav|4446|"Here, take it.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000002_000008.wav|4446|There aren't many such left.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000028_000001.wav|4446|"How jolly it was being young, Hilda!
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000033_000002.wav|4446|I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you gave her a franc.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000050_000002.wav|4446|You must go now, Bartley.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000012_000001.wav|4446|"It's the air of the whole place here that I like.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000035_000005.wav|4446|He had shut his eyes to give him the courage, he remembered, and she had trembled so-
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000034_000002.wav|4446|She looked at us with such despair and longing, out from under her black shawl.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000037_000003.wav|4446|Mac is writing one; really for me this time.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000006_000000.wav|4446|When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000002_000009.wav|4446|American tours have spoiled them, I'm afraid.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000038_000002.wav|4446|Shall you wear yellow gowns?
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000037_000001.wav|4446|"Well, we are neither of us twenty now, you know.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000034_000004.wav|4446|I remember it touched me so.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000013_000000.wav|4446|"Rooms always look better by lamplight-in London, at least.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000001_000001.wav|4446|He found it a delightful little place and he met charming people there.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000010_000001.wav|4446|Where did you get those etchings?
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000015_000001.wav|4446|It's not worth much, but I love it.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000036_000002.wav|4446|I had quite forgotten-I was back there.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000022_000000.wav|4446|"Thank you.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000003_000000.wav|4446|Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000040_000003.wav|4446|But he's given me some good Irish songs.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000047_000000.wav|4446|"Ask a theatre lady if she's afraid of drafts!" Hilda laughed.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000038_000001.wav|4446|What kind of a part is it?
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000052_000003.wav|4446|Good night."
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000028_000004.wav|4446|Do you remember how sweet they smelled?"
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000020_000002.wav|4446|He drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was still no other he liked so well.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000054_000001.wav|4446|"Are you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?" she whispered.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000033_000003.wav|4446|I was frightened at your prodigality."
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000024_000002.wav|4446|How did her son turn out?
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000034_000003.wav|4446|What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs, but just our youth.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000034_000001.wav|4446|What a strong brown face she had, and very tragic.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000037_000002.wav|4446|Have I told you about my new play?
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000019_000000.wav|4446|"It's not particularly rare," she said, "but some of it was my mother's.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000035_000000.wav|4446|They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: "God give you a happy love!"
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000037_000004.wav|4446|You see, I'm coming on."
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000027_000005.wav|4446|I gave her all my old clothes, even my old hats, though she always wears her Breton headdress.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000021_000001.wav|4446|I don't drink it myself, but I like to see it behave when it's poured.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000002_000003.wav|4446|On other matters he was perfectly rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000022_000001.wav|4446|But I don't like it so well as this." Bartley held the yellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000017_000000.wav|4446|"My dining room," Hilda explained, as she led the way, "is the tiniest place you have ever seen."
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000011_000000.wav|4446|"Lady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000052_000002.wav|4446|This isn't fair, you know.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000041_000000.wav|4446|She sat down at the piano and sang.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000013_000001.wav|4446|Though Marie is clean-really clean, as the French are.
test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000003_000002.wav|4446|For the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure.

test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000037_000000.wav|4446|Hilda laughed and went over to the piano.

test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000007_000000.wav|237|When he had been mowing the better part of an hour, he heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000009_000000.wav|237|"But I will be, in a minute.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000003_000004.wav|237|The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000014_000006.wav|237|Lou's wife needn't talk.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000022_000001.wav|237|One room is papered, carpeted, over furnished; the next is almost bare.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000005_000003.wav|237|Unconscious respect, probably, for he seemed intent upon his own thoughts, and, like the Gladiator's, they were far away.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000017_000016.wav|237|They think you're proud because you've been away to school or something."
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000017_000003.wav|237|Indeed, he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000017_000012.wav|237|If once I get Frank to the supper, I'll see that I stay for the dance.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000013_000001.wav|237|"Oh, there's no denying you're a spunky little bunch, you Czechs," he called back over his shoulder.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000021_000001.wav|237|There were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the place looked not unlike a tiny village.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000017_000015.wav|237|It hurts their feelings if you don't.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000008_000006.wav|237|I was going to give you a lift, if you were done." She gathered up her reins.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000010_000000.wav|237|"Free thinkers," replied the young woman laconically.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000017_000009.wav|237|Maybe the supper will tempt him.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000012_000000.wav|237|"We'd do it right over again, most of us," said the young woman hotly.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000015_000001.wav|237|"Oh, you know Annie!" She looked at the young man's bare arms.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000009_000003.wav|237|Just wait till I finish off the Kourdnas'. By the way, they were Bohemians.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000017_000002.wav|237|He felt it rather than saw it.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000002_000001.wav|237|His wife now lies beside him, and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000011_000002.wav|237|They still jaw about it in history classes."
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000006_000001.wav|237|He was not thinking about the tired pioneers over whom his blade glittered.
test-clean/237/134493/237_134493_000021_000003.wav|237|There was something individual about the great farm, a most unusual trimness and care for detail.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000001.wav|237|I'm going to pick cherries. Isn't everything beautiful after the rain?
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000017_000000.wav|237|Emil had nothing to say to this.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000011_000000.wav|237|Emil paused and straightened his back.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000001_000004.wav|237|Frank read English slowly, and the more he read about this divorce case, the angrier he grew.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000028_000000.wav|237|Marie's face fell under his brooding gaze.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000027_000003.wav|237|"Would you rather I went off in the sand hills and lived like Ivar?"
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000029_000003.wav|237|I want to be doing something on my own account."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000002.wav|237|Oh, but I'm glad to get this place mowed!
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000004_000008.wav|237|His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000016_000000.wav|237|"Why is it?
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000016_000003.wav|237|I feel as if this tree knows everything I ever think of when I sit here.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000030_000000.wav|237|"That's so," Marie sighed.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000000.wav|237|"Don't let me disturb you, Emil.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000030_000002.wav|237|Almost anything you choose."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000006_000000.wav|237|"If I cut the grass, I will," Emil said teasingly.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000035_000007.wav|237|If you WON'T understand, you know, I could make you!"
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000003_000001.wav|237|She thought it hard that the Goulds, for whom she had nothing but good will, should make her so much trouble.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000019_000000.wav|237|"Yes.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000032_000000.wav|237|Marie looked up at his defiant figure and her face clouded.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000001_000000.wav|237|On the evening of the day of Alexandra's call at the Shabatas', a heavy rain set in.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000017_000002.wav|237|He dropped a handful into her lap.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000036_000000.wav|237|Marie clasped her hands and started up from her seat.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000024_000000.wav|237|Marie shrugged her shoulders.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000010.wav|237|Will you have to cut them, too?"
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000036_000002.wav|237|We shall have to behave like mr Linstrum.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000036_000004.wav|237|"That won't last.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000024_000001.wav|237|"Oh, you don't know Alexandra as well as you think you do!
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000031_000000.wav|237|"And there are so many, many things I can't do." Emil echoed her tone sarcastically.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000004_000006.wav|237|Emil had already begun work and was mowing vigorously.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000036_000005.wav|237|It will go away, and things will be just as they used to. I wish you were a Catholic.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000004.wav|237|The wind wakened me.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000027_000000.wav|237|"Why not?
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000021_000001.wav|237|They were old friends."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000036_000007.wav|237|I pray for you, but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000007_000004.wav|237|Oh, I don't mean all of them, I mean that low place down by my tree, where there are so many.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000041_000001.wav|237|Marie took up her cherries and went slowly toward the house, crying bitterly.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000013_000001.wav|237|"Do they?
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000001_000002.wav|237|One of the Goulds was getting a divorce, and Frank took it as a personal affront.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000004_000007.wav|237|When he saw her coming, he stopped and wiped his brow.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000033_000000.wav|237|"Thank you," he returned shortly.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000035_000003.wav|237|You'll have to get some other little boy to play with." He stopped and took a deep breath.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000014_000002.wav|237|I'm a good Catholic, but I think I could get along with caring for trees, if I hadn't anything else."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000007_000008.wav|237|I'll call you if I see a snake."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000012_000000.wav|237|Marie went on as if she had not heard him.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000007_000003.wav|237|Please leave the roses till last, if you must cut them.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000007_000007.wav|237|Good bye.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000006_000002.wav|237|What makes you so flighty?"
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000028_000001.wav|237|She looked down at his wet leggings.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000029_000001.wav|237|Alexandra can run the farm all right, without me.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000041_000000.wav|237|Emil gripped the hand holds of his scythe and began to mow.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000003_000004.wav|237|Frank and Lou Bergson had very similar ideas, and they were two of the political agitators of the county.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000022_000000.wav|237|"Oh, Emil, you know what I mean!" Marie tossed her head impatiently. "Does she really care about him?
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000020_000000.wav|237|"Oh, ever so much; only he seems kind of staid and school teachery. But, of course, he is older than Frank, even.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000001_000001.wav|237|Frank sat up until a late hour reading the Sunday newspapers.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000016_000002.wav|237|I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000007_000001.wav|237|I suppose that's the wet season, too, then.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000035_000006.wav|237|It's then that I want to pull the corners of the Divide together.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000023_000002.wav|237|"She wouldn't know how to go about it.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000007_000005.wav|237|Aren't you splashed!
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000007_000000.wav|237|"Am I flighty?
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000027_000001.wav|237|I must go somewhere, mustn't I?"
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000025_000004.wav|237|What more do you want?
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000025_000005.wav|237|I like to talk to Carl about New York and what a fellow can do there."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000034_000000.wav|237|She sighed despondently.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000009.wav|237|I suppose it's the wet season.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000024_000004.wav|237|I like him because he appreciates her more than you do."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000026_000001.wav|237|Surely you are not thinking of going off there?"
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000019_000001.wav|237|Don't you?"
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000035_000001.wav|237|"I can't play with you like a little boy any more," he said slowly.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000022_000001.wav|237|When she used to tell me about him, I always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with him."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000031_000002.wav|237|I get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down, up and down."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000007.wav|237|They are always so spicy after a rain.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000016_000001.wav|237|If I feel that way, I feel that way.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000023_000001.wav|237|"Alexandra's never been in love, you crazy!" He laughed again.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000037_000001.wav|237|Emil stood defiant, gazing down at her.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000005.wav|237|Didn't it blow dreadfully?
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000014_000000.wav|237|"I don't know all of them, but I know lindens are.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000039_000000.wav|237|Marie turned away, wringing her hands.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000011_000001.wav|237|"I don't know.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000032_000001.wav|237|"I wish you weren't so restless, and didn't get so worked up over things," she said sadly.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000028_000002.wav|237|"I'm sure Alexandra hopes you will stay on here," she murmured.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000002_000001.wav|237|Listen here what he do wit his money." And Frank began the catalogue of the young man's reputed extravagances.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000023_000003.wav|237|The idea!"
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000014_000001.wav|237|The old people in the mountains plant lindens to purify the forest, and to do away with the spells that come from the old trees they say have lasted from heathen times.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000008.wav|237|We never had so many of them in here before.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000040_000001.wav|237|I never expect to have any more."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000007_000002.wav|237|It's exciting to see everything growing so fast,--and to get the grass cut!
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000026_000000.wav|237|"Oh, Emil!
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000018_000000.wav|237|"Do you like mr Linstrum?" Marie asked suddenly.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000035_000005.wav|237|You don't help things any by pretending.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000005_000003.wav|237|When I heard it raining in the night, I thought maybe you would come and do it for me to day.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000009_000002.wav|237|South of the apricot trees, cornering on the wheatfield, was Frank's alfalfa, where myriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering above the purple blossoms.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000035_000002.wav|237|"That's what you miss, Marie.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000023_000000.wav|237|"Who, Alexandra?" Emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000004_000005.wav|237|She ran into the house, put on a short skirt and a pair of her husband's boots, caught up a tin pail and started for the orchard.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000004_000002.wav|237|The orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000034_000001.wav|237|"Everything I say makes you cross, don't it?
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000020_000002.wav|237|Do you think Alexandra likes him very much?"
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000038_000000.wav|237|"I can't pray to have the things I want," he said slowly, "and I won't pray not to have them, not if I'm damned for it."
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000036_000003.wav|237|And, anyhow, there's nothing to understand!" She struck the ground with her little foot fiercely.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000007_000006.wav|237|Look at the spider webs all over the grass.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000036_000006.wav|237|The Church helps people, indeed it does.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000015_000000.wav|237|"That's a poor saying," said Emil, stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000004_000004.wav|237|That invitation decided her.
test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000034_000002.wav|237|And you never used to be cross to me."

test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000058_000001.wav|6829|But I'll have a trial in a few days, they say.

test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000014_000000.wav|6829|"We wish to talk with him," answered Kenneth.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000073_000002.wav|6829|You may as well understand, sir, that I stand for the Democratic candidate, and have no sympathy with your side."

test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000046_000000.wav|6829|"Couldn't her parents have helped her?" inquired Kenneth.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000054_000000.wav|6829|He spoke simply, but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them. It was evident that his feelings were deeper than he cared to make evident.

test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000051_000002.wav|6829|Then Rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around, and wait upon her, and the place went to rack and ruin."

test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000048_000000.wav|6829|"Oh, did she have an accident?" asked Beth.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000061_000001.wav|6829|It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000024_000000.wav|6829|"Thank you, mr Markham," replied a quiet voice, as a young man came forward from the dim interior of the cell.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000100_000002.wav|6829|And now we must find the girl."
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000094_000000.wav|6829|"Pay it, Ken," she whispered.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000045_000002.wav|6829|I had to stand by Lucy-she's so sweet and gentle, and so sensitive.

test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000063_000001.wav|6829|It won't be much, but I'm grateful to find a friend. I'm guilty, you know, and there's no one to blame but myself."
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000086_000001.wav|6829|I'll pay twice sixty dollars for the delivery to me of the forged check, and the withdrawal of the prosecution."
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000004_000000.wav|6829|"But it was a generous act, too," said Beth.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000077_000000.wav|6829|"He's a forger, mr Forbes; a deliberate criminal."
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000051_000000.wav|6829|"He was fairly prosperous before that, for mrs Rogers was an energetic and sensible woman, and kept old Will hard at work.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000010_000000.wav|6829|"We're going to try it, anyhow," was the prompt decision.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000028_000000.wav|6829|"Miss DeGraf," said Kenneth, noticing the boy's face critically, as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000092_000000.wav|6829|Kenneth hesitated a moment.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000045_000003.wav|6829|I don't say I did right.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000093_000000.wav|6829|Beth, uneasy at his silence, nudged him.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000055_000000.wav|6829|"Whose name did you sign to the check?" asked Kenneth.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000090_000001.wav|6829|Please look at the matter from a business standpoint.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000017_000001.wav|6829|that's different," observed Markham, altering his demeanor. "You mustn't mind my being gruff and grumpy, mr Forbes.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000035_000000.wav|6829|He was silent and turned his face away.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000074_000001.wav|6829|I've come to talk with you about young Gates."

test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000091_000000.wav|6829|"You're right.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000058_000002.wav|6829|My crime is so serious that the circuit judge has to sit on the case."
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000050_000000.wav|6829|"Her husband didn't tell us that," said the girl.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000008_000000.wav|6829|"Is there no way to save him?" asked Kenneth.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000049_000000.wav|6829|"Yes.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000015_000000.wav|6829|"Talk! what's the good?
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000028_000001.wav|6829|"Will you leave us alone, please, mr Markham?"
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000041_000000.wav|6829|"Lucy is very proud.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000007_000001.wav|6829|"Indeed there is never an excuse for crime.
test-clean/6829/68769/6829_68769_000084_000000.wav|6829|"I'll make your money loss good."
test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000030_000001.wav|6829|Then she gave a little laugh, and replied:

test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000045_000000.wav|6829|"I wish," said Beth, slowly, "I knew you."

test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000035_000000.wav|6829|For the first time the maid seemed a little confused, and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000047_000000.wav|6829|"I wish I knew myself," she cried, fiercely.
test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000018_000003.wav|6829|A speakers' stand, profusely decorated, had been erected on the lawn, and hundreds of folding chairs provided for seats.

test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000015_000000.wav|6829|Patsy and Beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations.
test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000046_000000.wav|6829|A sudden wave of scarlet swept over Eliza's face.
test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000038_000002.wav|6829|I have a headache."
test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000042_000003.wav|6829|You must excuse me."
test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000008_000000.wav|6829|This canvass was quite satisfactory, for final report showed only about a hundred majority for Forbes.

test-clean/6829/68771/6829_68771_000012_000002.wav|6829|This was why he held several long conferences with his friend Marshall, the manager at the mill.

test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000043_000001.wav|1580|"Well, if there is nothing to be learned here, we had best go inside."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000099_000000.wav|1580|"No, sir-certainly not."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000018_000004.wav|1580|Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000014_000000.wav|1580|"Pray continue your very interesting statement."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000040_000002.wav|1580|All right; come if you want to.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000058_000000.wav|1580|"Have you been in it since your adventure?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000046_000000.wav|1580|"By the window there."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000045_000001.wav|1580|"One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day.

test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000073_000000.wav|1580|"Let us be practical," said he.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000015_000001.wav|1580|He denied it, however, with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000049_000000.wav|1580|"Ah, that's good!
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000051_000002.wav|1580|The pencil was not an ordinary one.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000123_000001.wav|1580|Now, mr Soames, we will take a walk in the quadrangle, if you please."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000056_000015.wav|1580|Where does that door lead to?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000006_000000.wav|1580|My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.

test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000041_000001.wav|1580|A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000045_000003.wav|1580|Which chair?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000017_000000.wav|1580|"Excellent!" said Holmes, who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000044_000001.wav|1580|We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examination of the carpet.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000057_000000.wav|1580|"To my bedroom."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000078_000000.wav|1580|Soames hesitated.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000081_000001.wav|1580|The lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine scholar and athlete, plays in the Rugby team and the cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and the long jump.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000056_000007.wav|1580|No, I see nothing.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000031_000000.wav|1580|"Did this man Bannister know?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000109_000002.wav|1580|I nearly fainted, sir."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000006_000002.wav|1580|He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000041_000006.wav|1580|Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000086_000000.wav|1580|"Exactly.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000106_000000.wav|1580|"Anyone in the room could get out?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000010_000001.wav|1580|The proof was in three long slips.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000063_000001.wav|1580|Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000095_000000.wav|1580|"It was about half past four.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000026_000000.wav|1580|"Possibly."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000039_000000.wav|1580|Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000016_000002.wav|1580|I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of the room.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000008_000005.wav|1580|I was absent rather more than an hour.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000112_000001.wav|1580|Why did you pass these other chairs?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000009_000004.wav|1580|I found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000007_000001.wav|1580|I am one of the examiners.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000005_000003.wav|1580|I beg you, mr Holmes, to do what you can."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000107_000000.wav|1580|"Yes, sir."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000074_000000.wav|1580|"Yes, there are."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000114_000001.wav|1580|He was looking very bad-quite ghastly."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000021_000000.wav|1580|"For which he was entered?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000083_000002.wav|1580|He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000069_000000.wav|1580|"Surely there is another alternative, mr Holmes.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000013_000002.wav|1580|How could you possibly know that?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000034_000001.wav|1580|I left him collapsed in the chair.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000018_000003.wav|1580|Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches long-not a mere scratch, but a positive cut.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000047_000003.wav|1580|I have finished with the carpet.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000049_000002.wav|1580|Let me see the three strips.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000079_000000.wav|1580|"It is a very delicate question," said he.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000018_000006.wav|1580|There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000028_000000.wav|1580|"no"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000096_000000.wav|1580|"How long did you stay?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000123_000000.wav|1580|"Very good.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000049_000007.wav|1580|Then he tossed it down and seized the next.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000047_000006.wav|1580|The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000056_000012.wav|1580|And the cut-a positive tear, I see.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000008_000002.wav|1580|I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000047_000000.wav|1580|"I see.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000108_000000.wav|1580|"When mr Soames returned and called for you, you were very much disturbed?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000008_000001.wav|1580|The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides.

test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000056_000004.wav|1580|You are aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker's name.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000018_000000.wav|1580|"This was not all.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000040_000000.wav|1580|"Well," said he, "let us go round.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000049_000001.wav|1580|Well, anyhow, that was in his mind.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000081_000004.wav|1580|My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and industrious.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000098_000000.wav|1580|"Did you look at these papers on the table?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000041_000004.wav|1580|It was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000018_000002.wav|1580|I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was smooth and unstained.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000011_000000.wav|1580|Holmes stirred for the first time.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000045_000000.wav|1580|"I am afraid there are no signs here," said he.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000025_000000.wav|1580|"But might be recognized as proofs?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000038_000000.wav|1580|"So it seems to me."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000051_000001.wav|1580|This is of interest, Watson.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000010_000002.wav|1580|I had left them all together.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000060_000004.wav|1580|What about this curtain?
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000056_000005.wav|1580|Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann?" He held the small table sideways to the electric light.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000060_000000.wav|1580|"I should like to have a glance round.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000047_000007.wav|1580|He carried them over to the window table, because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000071_000000.wav|1580|"Exactly.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000041_000005.wav|1580|Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000081_000005.wav|1580|He will do well.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000016_000003.wav|1580|I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000093_000000.wav|1580|"It was most unfortunate, sir.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000042_000000.wav|1580|"He must have entered through the door.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000065_000000.wav|1580|"What could he have wanted there?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000090_000000.wav|1580|"I understand," said Holmes, "that you left your key in the door?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000087_000002.wav|1580|His plump face was twitching with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000110_000001.wav|1580|Where were you when you began to feel bad?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000056_000006.wav|1580|"I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000044_000000.wav|1580|The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room.

test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000076_000000.wav|1580|"Yes."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000018_000005.wav|1580|I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers.

test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000101_000001.wav|1580|I thought I would come back for the key. Then I forgot."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000060_000007.wav|1580|No one there, I suppose?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000015_000002.wav|1580|The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000016_000000.wav|1580|"Bannister was very much upset by the incident.

test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000035_000000.wav|1580|"You left your door open?"
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000018_000009.wav|1580|You see my dilemma.
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000024_000000.wav|1580|"To the best of my belief, they were rolled up."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000085_000001.wav|1580|But, of the three, he is perhaps the least unlikely."
test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000051_000000.wav|1580|"Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it again.

test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000041_000002.wav|1580|On the ground floor was the tutor's room.

test-clean/1580/141083/1580_141083_000042_000001.wav|1580|There is no opening except the one pane," said our learned guide.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000091_000006.wav|1580|I flopped down into that chair, and nothing would budge me until mr Soames he went for you.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000006_000000.wav|1580|It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000076_000006.wav|1580|I dismissed that.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000029_000001.wav|1580|All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000069_000001.wav|1580|He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step and a pleasant, open face.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000064_000000.wav|1580|The man's face set in sullen defiance.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000077_000004.wav|1580|I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less than that would have a chance.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000019_000001.wav|1580|The Indian still paced his room.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000077_000003.wav|1580|I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000018_000002.wav|1580|I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000029_000000.wav|1580|There were only four stationers of any consequences in the town, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid high for a duplicate.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000007_000001.wav|1580|"Is it possible?"
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000040_000003.wav|1580|Look at that!"
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000071_000000.wav|1580|The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Bannister.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000025_000000.wav|1580|"Who?"
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000039_000000.wav|1580|"But what fresh evidence could you have got?"
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000031_000000.wav|1580|Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000080_000002.wav|1580|What was it you put on that chair near the window?"
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000040_000001.wav|1580|It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000009_000005.wav|1580|I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000088_000000.wav|1580|Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000077_000002.wav|1580|Such an idea was absurd.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000014_000001.wav|1580|"And now, mr Soames, I wish you good night."

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000050_000004.wav|1580|I'll take the armchair in the middle.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000057_000000.wav|1580|"Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000091_000003.wav|1580|Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday, when the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was mr Gilchrist's tan gloves a lying in that chair.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000085_000000.wav|1580|"Good heavens! have you nothing to add?" cried Soames.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000076_000004.wav|1580|If the proofs were in a roll, he could not possibly know what they were.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000092_000000.wav|1580|"No, indeed," said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000038_000000.wav|1580|"Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery."

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000082_000000.wav|1580|Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000024_000002.wav|1580|Pencils, too, and knives-all was satisfactory.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000050_000000.wav|1580|"I think so.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000016_000002.wav|1580|It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000009_000007.wav|1580|The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000079_000002.wav|1580|As he passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000048_000000.wav|1580|"He shall not compete."
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000082_000001.wav|1580|"He put his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000069_000000.wav|1580|An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the student.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000079_000005.wav|1580|It was not a dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000015_000003.wav|1580|I must take some definite action to night.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000070_000002.wav|1580|We can be perfectly frank with each other.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000080_000001.wav|1580|He put his shoes on the table.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000086_000004.wav|1580|You will see that I have said, 'I have determined not to go in for the examination.

test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000083_000000.wav|1580|The student had drawn himself erect.
test-clean/1580/141084/1580_141084_000029_000002.wav|1580|My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation.

test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000003_000001.wav|8230|I shall discuss this question in later lectures.

test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000013_000003.wav|8230|One of these is context.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000013_000001.wav|8230|There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of "pastness," especially where immediate memory is concerned.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000029_000002.wav|8230|I am not sure that there is anything substantial in this point.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000008_000000.wav|8230|In the second place, images without beliefs are insufficient to constitute memory; and habits are still more insufficient.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000004_000006.wav|8230|How, then, are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation?

test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000006_000002.wav|8230|It is not logically necessary to the existence of a memory belief that the event remembered should have occurred, or even that the past should have existed at all.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000013_000004.wav|8230|A recent memory has, usually, more context than a more distant one.

test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000018_000000.wav|8230|Some points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000003_000003.wav|8230|Sensation, we decided, is not a form of knowledge.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000027_000003.wav|8230|Here we have a definite influence of past experience, but not necessarily any actual knowledge of the past.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000005.wav|8230|Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000017_000003.wav|8230|Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling, or related to, what is remembered.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000009_000001.wav|8230|How is it possible to know that a memory image is an imperfect copy, without having a more accurate copy by which to replace it?
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000009.wav|8230|Thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000001.wav|8230|It might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic, but I do not think this is the case.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000017_000002.wav|8230|But the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000008_000003.wav|8230|And the same applies to images.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000005.wav|8230|There are occasions when familiarity does not attach itself to any definite object, when there is merely a vague feeling that SOMETHING is familiar.
test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000010_000001.wav|8230|We will take the second of these points first.

test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000023_000001.wav|7176|At the sudden sharp sting of it, the great bird turned his head and noticed, for the first time, the fisherman standing on the bank.
test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000002_000000.wav|7176|He was plainly a duck.

test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000011_000002.wav|7176|In despair he hurled himself downward too soon.
test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000023_000002.wav|7176|At the same moment he felt the light restraint of the almost invisible leader upon his wings, where the other two flies had affixed themselves.
test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000009_000002.wav|7176|But behind him, overtaking him inexorably, came the shape that stood for doom itself in the eyes of all his tribe-the dreadful blue falcon, or duck hawk.

test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000011_000000.wav|7176|Close ahead of him now the teal saw refuge-the flashing line of the rapids.
test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000009_000000.wav|7176|Just about this time, in the clear blue overhead, a green winged teal was beating his way above the treetops, making for the stream with the fear of death at his heart.
test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000010_000002.wav|7176|For all its appalling speed, the sound of his flight was nothing more than a strong pulsating hiss.

test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000019_000002.wav|7176|The rapids would presently come to an end.
test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000015_000003.wav|7176|With only head and wings above the mad smother, he flapped onward frantically, beating down the foam about him.
test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000016_000002.wav|7176|As long as his body was completely submerged, it was at the mercy of the twisting and tortured currents, which rolled him over and over, in spite of his swimming craft.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000006_000006.wav|7176|Can you give me a few hints?"--suppose you spoke to me like this, then I could do something for you.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000012_000000.wav|7176|These few remarks are called a soliloquy, being addressed rather to the world in general than to any particular person on the stage.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000094_000000.wav|7176|It makes a different thing of it altogether.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000056_000002.wav|7176|Then the curtain rises, and it is apparent that we are assisting at an At Home of considerable splendour.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000011_000000.wav|7176|And, so on in the same vein for some thirty lines.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000015_000000.wav|7176|Well, there are more ways than one; and now we come to what is meant by stagecraft.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000083_000000.wav|7176|Tea is the most usual meal on the stage, for the reason that it is the least expensive, the property lump of sugar being dusted and used again on the next night.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000018_000001.wav|7176|This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000020_000000.wav|7176|Let us, to give an example of how this method works, go back again to the play we have been discussing.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000092_000000.wav|7176|Well, I see I must tell you.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000022_000021.wav|7176|Yes, that's right.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000070_000003.wav|7176|This is how it should go:--
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000069_000001.wav|7176|Then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000013_000000.wav|7176|So the soliloquy came into being.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000031_000003.wav|7176|Why did Lord Arthur Fluffinose enter?
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000085_000004.wav|7176|Now this answer, even if it comes quite fresh to the stalls, will lose much of its effect if it is said without the assistance of a cigarette.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000028_000000.wav|7176|And so on.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000012_000003.wav|7176|Of course, a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000003_000002.wav|7176|The successful playwright is indeed a man to be envied. Leaving aside for the moment the question of super tax, the prizes which fall to his lot are worth something of an effort.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000069_000002.wav|7176|A stage meal is popular, because it proves to the audience that the actors, even when called Charles Hawtrey or Owen Nares, are real people just like you and me.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000083_000005.wav|7176|Besides, the thing is coming back again as chicken directly.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000089_000001.wav|7176|Once more:---
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000055_000000.wav|7176|The answer to this will depend upon the length of the play, for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises.
test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000035_000001.wav|7176|You will see this for yourself if you consider the passage as it should properly have been written:--

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000028_000001.wav|7176|Which strikes me as rather sweet and natural.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000004_000002.wav|7176|It was an unsatisfying life; and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did, he used to say that he was for the Bar.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000023_000001.wav|7176|You see how effective it is.

test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000012_000001.wav|7176|Now the object of this soliloquy is plain.

test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000029_000000.wav|7021|Then the doors were thrown open, and the King entered with a large suite of gentlemen in glittering uniforms and plumed hats.

test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000037_000000.wav|7021|But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000026_000001.wav|7021|He only shook his head.

test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000002_000001.wav|7021|And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.

test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000019_000001.wav|7021|When she became aware of Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000016_000000.wav|7021|"Where may you be going?" asked one of the soldiers.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000035_000003.wav|7021|He ran so fast that the Princess's necklace fell off his neck, and all the cakes jumped out of his pockets.

test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000035_000001.wav|7021|He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000014_000000.wav|7021|"Yes, why not?" thought Anders.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000015_000000.wav|7021|And so he did.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000042_000000.wav|7021|Then Anders felt brave again.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000004_000002.wav|7021|He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000035_000002.wav|7021|He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000034_000000.wav|7021|Anders did not answer.
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000038_000002.wav|7021|He cuddled up to his mother and asked:
test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000036_000001.wav|7021|And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.

test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000059_000001.wav|7021|By the third method the mother secures the compliance of the child by a direct exercise of authority.

test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000065_000004.wav|7021|And a child who never, from the beginning, finds any efficiency in them, never learns to employ them at all.

test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000006_000001.wav|7021|They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000010_000002.wav|7021|We can not surrender this trust.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000015_000002.wav|7021|Nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution, and the medicine was ready.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000019_000000.wav|7021|So saying, she led the way on tiptoe, followed by the children out of the room, and round by a circuitous route to the piazza.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000013_000000.wav|7021|"Ah!" said Della in a tone of great concern, and looking again at Andella, "I heard that you had been sick.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000022_000001.wav|7021|If you can lead children to cure themselves of their faults in such a way that they shall have a good time in doing it, there is a double gain.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000021_000000.wav|7021|So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000007_000000.wav|7021|Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000017_000000.wav|7021|Delia was accustomed to use the dolls not only for the purpose of instruction, but sometimes for reproof, in many ingenious ways.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000020_000002.wav|7021|I would not have them know that their mothers leave their playthings about in that way for any consideration.

test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000011_000000.wav|7021|Then, turning to Jane, she asked, in a somewhat altered tone, "Has she been a good girl, Jane?"

test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000020_000001.wav|7021|Put them away quick before Andella and Rosalie see them.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000020_000000.wav|7021|"There!" said she, pointing to the playthings; "see! all your playthings left out!

test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000017_000002.wav|7021|They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000022_000000.wav|7021|Besides, a scolding would have made them unhappy, and this did not make them unhappy at all; it amused and entertained them.

test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000010_000000.wav|7021|"How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.
test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000018_000002.wav|7021|There is a secret-something I would not have them know on any account."

test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000024_000001.wav|260|'As if I would talk on such a subject!
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000011_000003.wav|260|I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.

test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000010_000002.wav|260|And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night?
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000011_000006.wav|260|I must have been changed for Mabel!
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000008_000000.wav|260|'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way!

test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000011_000004.wav|260|Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is-oh dear!
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000003_000002.wav|260|And how odd the directions will look!
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000002_000004.wav|260|Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'

test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000015_000001.wav|260|'How CAN I have done that?' she thought.
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000022_000000.wav|260|'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000026_000000.wav|260|So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear!

test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000024_000002.wav|260|Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000010_000004.wav|260|I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000024_000000.wav|260|'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000022_000001.wav|260|'Would YOU like cats if you were me?'

test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000018_000002.wav|260|That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to day.'
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000024_000003.wav|260|Don't let me hear the name again!'
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000021_000001.wav|260|The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings.
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000023_000000.wav|260|'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it.
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000005_000000.wav|260|Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
test-clean/260/123440/260_123440_000014_000002.wav|260|It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then?

test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000027_000002.wav|260|I return to the Icelander.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000013_000000.wav|260|I then remembered that the Professor, before starting, had estimated the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000017_000003.wav|260|Did he cross it?
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000060_000002.wav|260|The combatants alternately approach and recede from our raft.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000017_000000.wav|260|"That is just the question.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000008_000001.wav|260|No, not at all."
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000049_000000.wav|260|At three hundred yards from us the battle was fought.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000025_000000.wav|260|I looked at the hunter.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000060_000004.wav|260|Suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000017_000001.wav|260|Have we followed that road?
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000031_000003.wav|260|They possessed a perfect organisation, gigantic proportions, prodigious strength.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000029_000000.wav|260|Yes, indeed, those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal! The jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000036_000001.wav|260|The danger is approaching.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000033_000000.wav|260|I saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length.

test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000016_000000.wav|260|"But," I remarked, "since we have followed the road that Saknussemm has shown us-"
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000047_000001.wav|260|The reptiles rose; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000033_000002.wav|260|No; surely it cannot be!
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000060_000001.wav|260|The struggle continues with unabated ferocity.

test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000007.wav|260|The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000020_000000.wav|260|I take this as my answer, and I leave the Professor to bite his lips with impatience.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000028_000000.wav|260|"Teeth!" I cried, considering the iron bar with more attention.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000005_000000.wav|260|My uncle has had no dreams, but he is out of temper.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000061_000000.wav|260|All at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the plesiosaurus.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000044_000001.wav|260|"I can see its great fins.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000061_000005.wav|260|The spray almost blinds us.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000040_000000.wav|260|Hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away, rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000043_000002.wav|260|It is diving down!"
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000027_000001.wav|260|I had rather not disturb him while he is quiet.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000032_000001.wav|260|No human eye has ever beheld them living.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000045_000002.wav|260|They were of supernatural dimensions; the smallest of them would have crunched our raft, crew and all, at one snap of its huge jaws.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000006_000004.wav|260|Is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed?
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000038_000001.wav|260|The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of twenty fathoms.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000048_000000.wav|260|We stood dumb with fear.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000029_000002.wav|260|I could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000057_000001.wav|260|Two monsters only were creating all this commotion; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000045_000001.wav|260|We stood amazed, thunderstruck, at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000043_000001.wav|260|Look at its vast jaws and its rows of teeth!
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000009_000000.wav|260|"Impatient, then?"
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000035_000000.wav|260|I look at our guns and see that they are all right.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000061_000002.wav|260|I no longer see his scaly armour.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000023_000000.wav|260|My uncle took soundings several times.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000037_000002.wav|260|Hans was at the helm.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000048_000003.wav|260|I prepare to fire.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000060_000005.wav|260|Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under water.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000019_000002.wav|260|Therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects."
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000035_000001.wav|260|My uncle notices it, and looks on approvingly.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000039_000001.wav|260|"Have we struck land?"
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000033_000003.wav|260|Yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000019_000001.wav|260|I came with an object, and I mean to attain it.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000002.wav|260|Weather unchanged.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000055_000000.wav|260|"And the other?"
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000060_000003.wav|260|We remain motionless, ready to fire.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000005_000001.wav|260|He examines the horizon all round with his glass, and folds his arms with the air of an injured man.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000047_000000.wav|260|Flight was out of the question now.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000012_000001.wav|260|I am not complaining that the rate is slow, but that the sea is so wide."
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000006_000002.wav|260|And yet, what cause was there for anger?
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000003_000002.wav|260|The horizon seems extremely distant.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000019_000000.wav|260|"But I don't care for prospects.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000003.wav|260|The wind freshens.

test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000047_000003.wav|260|I took up my rifle.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000012_000000.wav|260|"What does that signify?
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000011_000000.wav|260|"Yet we are going very fast."
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000057_000002.wav|260|I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal, and as large as a man's head.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000031_000001.wav|260|The world then belonged to reptiles.

test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000053_000000.wav|260|"Surely you must be mistaken," I cried.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000034_000003.wav|260|What a very bad notion that was of his, I thought to myself, to take soundings just here!
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000024_000000.wav|260|But when the pick was shipped again, Hans pointed out on its surface deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard bodies.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000038_000000.wav|260|Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000004.wav|260|On awaking, my first thought was to observe the intensity of the light.

test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000049_000002.wav|260|But it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the fray-the porpoise, the whale, the lizard, the tortoise.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000004_000000.wav|260|My head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000022_000001.wav|260|It must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic-and why not?
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000005.wav|260|I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim, or fail altogether.

test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000010_000000.wav|260|"One might be, with less reason than now."
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000061_000004.wav|260|The water is splashed for a long way around.
test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000042_000000.wav|260|"Yes," replied my uncle, "and there is a sea lizard of vast size."

test-clean/6930/75918/6930_75918_000034_000000.wav|6930|"What annoyance?"
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000044_000001.wav|8555|I'm the Boolooroo!"
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000024_000001.wav|8555|When he finished she said cheerfully:

test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000009_000000.wav|8555|However, as the two forces came nearer together, Button Bright spied Trot and Cap'n Bill standing before the enemy, and the sight astonished him considerably.
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000007_000000.wav|8555|In this order they proceeded to the main gate, which Trot ordered the guards to throw wide open.

test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000020_000003.wav|8555|But the people called upon him for a speech, so he faced the Blueskins and said:
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000046_000000.wav|8555|The former Boolooroo groaned.

test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000057_000000.wav|8555|This was done, the once royal family departing from the palace with shamed and downcast looks.
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000032_000000.wav|8555|"No," said Trot, positively, "there's been enough patching in this country and I won't have any more of it.
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000033_000000.wav|8555|"You are, mate," replied the sailor.

test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000038_000000.wav|8555|So the Captain of the Guards was given the key and told to fetch the Boolooroo from the Room of the Great Knife.
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000051_000002.wav|8555|Can't they be discharged?"
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000042_000000.wav|8555|"I'll gladly do that," promised the new Boolooroo; "and I'll feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat, besides the grass.

test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000011_000000.wav|8555|"Hooray!" yelled the parrot,

test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000049_000000.wav|8555|"Can't I take any of the treasure with me?" he pleaded.
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000050_000000.wav|8555|"Not even a bird cage," said she.
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000043_000000.wav|8555|As they led the now famous animal from the room the Boolooroo shuddered and said:
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000034_000001.wav|8555|It will be such a satisfaction."
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000058_000000.wav|8555|Then the Room of the Great Knife was cleared of its awful furniture.
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000039_000000.wav|8555|When the courtiers and the people assembled saw the goat they gave a great cheer, for the beast had helped to dethrone their wicked Ruler.
test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000048_000000.wav|8555|"You won't be hurt," answered the girl, "but you'll have to find some other place to stay besides this palace, an' perhaps you'll enjoy workin' for a livin, by way of variety."

test-clean/8555/284449/8555_284449_000028_000001.wav|8555|Then she gave Rosalie back her magic ring, thanking the kind Witch for all she had done for them.

test-clean/1284/1180/1284_1180_000016_000001.wav|1284|And in the Munchkin Country?" she exclaimed.

test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000044_000003.wav|121|The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time.
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000024_000002.wav|121|Yes, she was in love. That is, she had been.

test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000023_000002.wav|121|She was in love."
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000038_000001.wav|121|But it's rather nice, his long reticence."
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000007_000003.wav|121|This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait.

test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000012_000000.wav|121|He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to qualify it.
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000024_000000.wav|121|He laughed for the first time.

test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000036_000000.wav|121|He sprang to his feet again.
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000021_000000.wav|121|"Because the thing had been such a scare?"
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000016_000000.wav|121|He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant.

test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000018_000001.wav|121|I took that HERE"--he tapped his heart. "I've never lost it."
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000012_000001.wav|121|He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little wincing grimace.
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000020_000011.wav|121|She had never told anyone.

test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000030_000001.wav|121|mrs Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light.
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000016_000009.wav|121|To this his answer was prompt.
test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000042_000001.wav|121|Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so.
