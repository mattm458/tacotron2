224|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000013_000000.wav|4446|MacConnell grunted.
225|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000019_000004.wav|4446|A little attack of nerves, possibly."
226|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000005_000000.wav|4446|Mainhall laughed.
227|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000022_000012.wav|4446|He had been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her.
228|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000011_000001.wav|4446|"And have I done anything so fool as that, now?" he asked.
229|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000022_000005.wav|4446|When he wrote her that everything was changed for him, he was telling the truth.
230|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000018_000000.wav|4446|"I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously to night, isn't she?"
231|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000003_000005.wav|4446|She's apt to grow a bit stale after a time.
232|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000023_000000.wav|4446|"Of course," he reflected, "she always had that combination of something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft.
233|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000022_000003.wav|4446|Hilda had never replied to his letter.
234|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000020_000000.wav|4446|He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: "You know Lord Westmere, of course,--the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle.
235|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000007_000006.wav|4446|She's really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy tale."
236|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000010_000005.wav|4446|A man writes to the top of his bent only once."
237|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000008_000003.wav|4446|When she began to dance, by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar.
238|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000015_000002.wav|4446|He's been wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more.
239|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000023_000001.wav|4446|But I never thought she'd do anything.
240|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000015_000009.wav|4446|He's another who's awfully keen about her.
241|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000023_000002.wav|4446|She hadn't much ambition then, and she was too fond of trifles.
242|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000024_000000.wav|4446|Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.
243|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000015_000011.wav|4446|Sir Harry Towne, mr Bartley Alexander, the American engineer."
244|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000005_000005.wav|4446|Do you know, Alexander,"--Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,--"do you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself.
245|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000006_000002.wav|4446|As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander's attention to the stage.
246|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000004_000001.wav|4446|"Why, I haven't heard of her for-years."
247|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000015_000007.wav|4446|Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: "She's an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that.
248|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000001_000001.wav|4446|The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them.
249|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000023_000006.wav|4446|She was a daft, generous little thing.
250|test-clean/4446/2271/4446_2271_000015_000008.wav|4446|Here comes Sir Harry Towne.
251|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000033_000001.wav|4446|"Please tell me one thing, Bartley.
252|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000003.wav|4446|I won't promise.
253|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000001.wav|4446|"Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid of myself.
254|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000025_000000.wav|4446|He looked at her and his haggard face softened.
255|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000006.wav|4446|If I'd met you later, if I hadn't loved you so well-but that's all over, long ago.
256|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000000.wav|4446|Alexander rose and shook himself angrily.
257|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000014_000001.wav|4446|"I can't stand seeing you miserable."
258|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000000.wav|4446|Hilda shivered and sat still.
259|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000045_000000.wav|4446|Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again.
260|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000004.wav|4446|A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside.
261|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000006.wav|4446|"You want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people?
262|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000001.wav|4446|"It's too late to ask that.
263|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000007_000000.wav|4446|"There's something troubling you, Bartley.
264|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000005.wav|4446|"You see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different.
265|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000000.wav|4446|Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly.
266|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000047_000000.wav|4446|She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer.
267|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000031_000000.wav|4446|She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
268|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000005_000000.wav|4446|"I got in about ten minutes ago.
269|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000019_000000.wav|4446|"Always.
270|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000045_000001.wav|4446|Hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders.
271|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000029_000000.wav|4446|Alexander groaned.
272|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000003.wav|4446|You ask me to stay away from you because you want me!
273|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000036_000002.wav|4446|I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you.
274|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000004.wav|4446|What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg."
275|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000029_000002.wav|4446|We had only a few days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy."
276|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000008.wav|4446|"Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day!
277|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000006.wav|4446|I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have SOMETHING!"
278|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000033_000002.wav|4446|At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy."
279|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000033_000000.wav|4446|"Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve.
280|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000006.wav|4446|He stood his ground over by the windows until Hilda came in.
281|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000019_000001.wav|4446|But it's worse now.
282|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000027_000001.wav|4446|The first was-sort of in play, wasn't it?"
283|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000036_000001.wav|4446|I wanted you to eat all the cakes and have them, too.
284|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000006.wav|4446|But, if you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
285|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000005.wav|4446|"You want me to say it?" she whispered.
286|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000002.wav|4446|"It's got to be a clean break, Hilda.
287|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000008_000002.wav|4446|You and i"
288|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000013_000002.wav|4446|She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with her hand, then sank back upon her stool.
289|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000035_000000.wav|4446|She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:--
290|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000000.wav|4446|"No!" she gasped.
291|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000007.wav|4446|The shamefulness of your asking me to do that!
292|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000012.wav|4446|But why do you let me chatter on like this?
293|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000002.wav|4446|I must see you.
294|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000009.wav|4446|Do you understand?
295|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000031_000002.wav|4446|He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.
296|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000032_000001.wav|4446|You know.
297|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000025_000001.wav|4446|He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.
298|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000023_000000.wav|4446|"Could you-could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?"
299|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000000.wav|4446|"I understand, Bartley.
300|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000001_000001.wav|4446|The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
301|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000048_000000.wav|4446|"Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered.
302|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000007.wav|4446|Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding-hard as a steel spring.
303|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000002.wav|4446|I don't trust myself any more.
304|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000031_000001.wav|4446|Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too.
305|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000004.wav|4446|And I've got nobody but you.
306|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000001.wav|4446|I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness.
307|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000012_000000.wav|4446|"Everything!"
308|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000024_000002.wav|4446|I have thought about it until I am worn out."
309|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000001.wav|4446|Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth.
310|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000008.wav|4446|And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference."
311|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000006_000000.wav|4446|Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
312|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000000.wav|4446|"Just something Bartley.
313|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000002.wav|4446|"Each life spoils the other.
314|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000016_000001.wav|4446|He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
315|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000019_000003.wav|4446|It tortures me every minute."
316|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000007_000001.wav|4446|What is it?"
317|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000010.wav|4446|I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along.
318|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000006.wav|4446|I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here with you.
319|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000020_000000.wav|4446|"But why NOW?" she asked piteously, wringing her hands.
320|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000041_000000.wav|4446|Hilda sprang up like a flame.
321|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000047_000001.wav|4446|Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
322|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000007.wav|4446|She called his name on the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it. She merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder.
323|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000008_000000.wav|4446|Bartley bent lower over the fire.
324|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000000.wav|4446|Emerging at Euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to Bedford Square.
325|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000037_000000.wav|4446|Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.
326|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000030_000000.wav|4446|"Yes, I was happy, wasn't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Weren't you happy then, at all?"
327|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000005.wav|4446|It's different now.
328|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000041_000001.wav|4446|She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.
329|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000004.wav|4446|The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful-can I never make you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently.
330|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000010_000000.wav|4446|"What about us, Bartley?" she asked in a thin voice.
331|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000013.wav|4446|Come over to the fire; you're chilled through."
332|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000011_000001.wav|4446|At last Alexander brought out one word:--
333|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000048_000002.wav|4446|Forget everything except that I am here."
334|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000046_000003.wav|4446|I must know about you.
335|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000029_000001.wav|4446|"I meant to, but somehow I couldn't.
336|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000040_000003.wav|4446|I can't see you at all, anywhere.
337|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000044_000002.wav|4446|Why didn't you let me be angry with you?
338|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000022_000001.wav|4446|She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.
339|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000004.wav|4446|The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more.
340|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000003.wav|4446|I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don't dare trifle with it.

344|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000009_000001.wav|4446|She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.
345|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000011_000000.wav|4446|He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window.
346|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000004_000001.wav|4446|You haven't spoken a word."
347|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000001_000000.wav|4446|The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable.

349|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000004.wav|4446|It's abominable of you to ask me.
350|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000002.wav|4446|But I didn't know.
351|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000003.wav|4446|The room was empty when he entered.
352|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000006_000001.wav|4446|Hilda watched him with perplexity.
353|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000019_000002.wav|4446|It's unbearable.
354|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000008.wav|4446|If you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
355|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000009_000000.wav|4446|Hilda took a quick, soft breath.
356|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000014_000000.wav|4446|"I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley," she said tremulously.
357|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000043_000004.wav|4446|It's getting the better of me.
358|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000048_000001.wav|4446|"We've tortured each other enough for tonight.
359|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000024_000000.wav|4446|He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.
360|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000000.wav|4446|He ignored her question.
361|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000027_000000.wav|4446|"After the very first.
362|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000013_000000.wav|4446|Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright.
363|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000011.wav|4446|I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley.
364|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000007.wav|4446|I can do that."
365|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000013_000001.wav|4446|She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley.
366|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000042_000010.wav|4446|Bartley, you're cowardly!"
367|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000002.wav|4446|She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda's living room.
368|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000003_000000.wav|4446|She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl.
369|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000005.wav|4446|There is this deception between me and everything."
370|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000039_000000.wav|4446|"I can't," he said heavily.
371|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000036_000000.wav|4446|"You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything.

373|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000028_000000.wav|4446|Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.
374|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000016_000000.wav|4446|He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.
375|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000002_000005.wav|4446|Alexander did not sit down.
376|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000026_000000.wav|4446|She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her.
377|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000036_000003.wav|4446|I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successful-to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted."
378|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000004.wav|4446|What must I do that I've not done, or what must I not do?" She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair.
379|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000038_000003.wav|4446|You've only to tell me now.
380|test-clean/4446/2275/4446_2275_000021_000003.wav|4446|I get nothing but misery out of either.

383|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000015_000000.wav|4446|Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: "I've a neat little sum in the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway.
384|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000035_000003.wav|4446|They went home sadly with the lilacs, back to the Rue Saint Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm.
385|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000016_000000.wav|4446|Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served.
386|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000003_000001.wav|4446|He had a long talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a discontented state of mind.
387|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000020_000001.wav|4446|There was watercress soup, and sole, and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two small rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of which Bartley had always been very fond.
388|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000035_000002.wav|4446|Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized that he was in love. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply, had frightened them both.
389|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000019_000002.wav|4446|We always had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre-queer theatres, for that matter."

391|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000050_000003.wav|4446|Good night."
392|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000008_000003.wav|4446|It's owing to that same chance, by the way, that I am able to ask you to dinner.
393|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000050_000001.wav|4446|"Here, take it.
394|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000002_000008.wav|4446|There aren't many such left.

396|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000033_000002.wav|4446|I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you gave her a franc.

402|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000006_000000.wav|4446|When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs.

413|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000003_000000.wav|4446|Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon.
414|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000040_000003.wav|4446|But he's given me some good Irish songs.

416|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000038_000001.wav|4446|What kind of a part is it?
417|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000052_000003.wav|4446|Good night."

419|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000020_000002.wav|4446|He drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was still no other he liked so well.

421|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000033_000003.wav|4446|I was frightened at your prodigality."

424|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000034_000001.wav|4446|What a strong brown face she had, and very tragic.
425|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000037_000002.wav|4446|Have I told you about my new play?
426|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000019_000000.wav|4446|"It's not particularly rare," she said, "but some of it was my mother's.
427|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000002_000005.wav|4446|Hilda seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and Bartley himself was so pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse that he took his leave when they did, and walked with them over to Oxford Street, where they waited for their 'bus.
428|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000035_000000.wav|4446|They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: "God give you a happy love!"

432|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000002_000003.wav|4446|On other matters he was perfectly rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation.
433|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000022_000001.wav|4446|But I don't like it so well as this." Bartley held the yellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about.
434|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000017_000000.wav|4446|"My dining room," Hilda explained, as she led the way, "is the tiniest place you have ever seen."

441|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000037_000000.wav|4446|Hilda laughed and went over to the piano.

443|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000048_000000.wav|4446|Alexander caught the agitation in her voice.
444|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000051_000000.wav|4446|Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered in her ear: "You are giving me a chance?"

447|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000027_000002.wav|4446|Too bad!

452|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000009_000000.wav|4446|Alexander walked about the room, looking at everything.
453|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000032_000000.wav|4446|Hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly.
454|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000015_000002.wav|4446|I've managed to save something every year, and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons.
455|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000024_000001.wav|4446|I'm so sorry to hear it.
456|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000036_000003.wav|4446|It was very jolly," he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee.
457|test-clean/4446/2273/4446_2273_000035_000001.wav|4446|It was not in the ingratiating tone of the habitual beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor creature's sorrow, vibrating with pity for their youth and despair at the terribleness of human life; it had the anguish of a voice of prophecy.

701|test-clean/237/134500/237_134500_000023_000003.wav|237|The idea!"

745|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000003_000000.wav|237|The only place, except in front of the grand piano, where Polly approached a state of comparative happiness, was in the greenhouse.
746|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000015_000001.wav|237|Somehow, of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest, this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.

748|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000025_000000.wav|237|That brought Polly to.

751|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000051_000002.wav|237|To think that Phronsie had left her for any one!--even good mr King!
752|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000019_000000.wav|237|Polly sat up very straight, and whisked off the tears quickly.

755|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000035_000000.wav|237|"Phronsie," said Jasper quickly, "what do you suppose Prince said the other day?"
756|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000020_000000.wav|237|"Here, Polly, hold your arms," he had only strength to gasp.

759|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000022_000000.wav|237|"Here I'm!
760|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000049_000001.wav|237|"Oh! let's go back!" was all they heard!
761|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000055_000003.wav|237|"So you see, I was just in time; in the very nick of time, in fact!"
762|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000057_000000.wav|237|"And to think how fond the little girl is of you, father!" said mrs Whitney, who hadn't yet gotten over her extreme surprise at the old gentleman's complete subjection to the little Peppers: he, whom all children had by instinct always approached so carefully, and whom every one found it necessary to conciliate!
763|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000010_000000.wav|237|"Well," said Van, and he showed signs of relenting a little at that; "but Percy is perfectly awful, mamma, you don't know; and he feels so smart too," he said vindictively.
764|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000047_000000.wav|237|"Don't mind it, Polly," whispered Jasper; "twasn't her fault."
765|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000048_000000.wav|237|"Phronsie," said mrs Whitney, smilingly, stooping over the child, "would you like to see a little pussy I have for you?"
766|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000051_000000.wav|237|But Polly stood like a statue!
767|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000033_000001.wav|237|"There, there," he said soothingly, patting her brown, fuzzy head. Something was going down the old gentleman's neck, that wet his collar, and made him whisper very tenderly in her ear, "don't give way now, Polly; Phronsie'll see you."
768|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000025_000001.wav|237|"Oh, Phronsie!" she cried, and strained her to her heart; while the boys crowded around, and plied her with sudden questions.
769|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000060_000000.wav|237|"So they have: so they have," assented mr King, and then the conversation dropped.
770|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000013_000000.wav|237|"I'm afraid those wouldn't quite answer the purpose," said his mamma, smiling-"especially the last; yet we must think of something."
771|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000016_000000.wav|237|"Where is she?" said a voice over in front of the piano, in the gathering dusk-unmistakably mr King's.
772|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000015_000003.wav|237|"I shall have to give up!" she moaned.
773|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000014_000000.wav|237|But just here mr King thought it about time to take matters into his hands.
774|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000056_000000.wav|237|"So her mother was willing?" asked his daughter, curiously.
775|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000026_000000.wav|237|"Now you'll stay," cried Van; "say, Polly, won't you."
776|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000001_000000.wav|237|POLLY IS COMFORTED
777|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000023_000000.wav|237|But Polly couldn't speak; and if Jasper hadn't caught her just in time, she would have tumbled over backward from the stool, Phronsie and all!
778|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000033_000000.wav|237|But Polly's arms were around the old gentleman's neck, so she didn't hear.
779|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000014_000001.wav|237|So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn't be back to lunch.
780|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000030_000000.wav|237|And to be sure, our Polly's face was a study to behold.
781|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000002_000003.wav|237|At night, when no one knew it, the tears would come racing over the poor, forlorn little face, and would not be squeezed back.
782|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000011_000000.wav|237|"Well," said mrs Whitney, softly, "let's think what we can do for Polly; it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little face."
783|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000059_000000.wav|237|"So I hope," said mrs Whitney; "and father, I do believe they'll repay you; for I do think there's good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted."
784|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000032_000001.wav|237|"Father knew how to do it."
785|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000027_000000.wav|237|"Weren't you awfully surprised?" cried Percy; "say, Polly, awfully?"
786|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000004_000000.wav|237|Here she would stay, comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics, rejoicing the heart of Old Turner the gardener, who since Polly's first rapturous entrance, had taken her into his good graces for all time.
787|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000031_000000.wav|237|"Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over to mr King with Phronsie still in her arms.
788|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000055_000001.wav|237|"I wasn't coming without her, Marian, if it could possibly be managed.
789|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000049_000000.wav|237|But the chubby face didn't look up brightly, as usual: and the next moment, without a bit of warning, Phronsie sprang past them all, even Polly, and flung herself into mr King's arms, in a perfect torrent of sobs.

792|test-clean/237/126133/237_126133_000054_000000.wav|237|"She's the cunningest little thing I ever saw," said mrs Whitney, enthusiastically, afterward, aside to mr King.

3128|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000000.wav|8230|We often feel that something in our sensible environment is familiar, without having any definite recollection of previous occasions on which we have seen it.
3129|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000018_000002.wav|8230|The study of any topic is like the continued observation of an object which is approaching us along a road: what is certain to begin with is the quite vague knowledge that there is SOME object on the road.
3130|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000022_000003.wav|8230|The recollection alone is true memory.
3131|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000022_000004.wav|8230|This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory.
3132|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000029_000003.wav|8230|The definition of "my experience" is difficult; broadly speaking, it is everything that is connected with what I am experiencing now by certain links, of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.
3133|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000020_000000.wav|8230|The second datum is that we certainly have more capacity for knowing the past than for knowing the future.
3134|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000004_000008.wav|8230|To deal with this problem, we must have a theory of memory.
3135|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000012_000001.wav|8230|They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.
3136|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000003_000002.wav|8230|In the present lecture I shall attempt the analysis of memory knowledge, both as an introduction to the problem of knowledge in general, and because memory, in some form, is presupposed in almost all other knowledge.
3137|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000006_000005.wav|8230|Hence the occurrences which are CALLED knowledge of the past are logically independent of the past; they are wholly analysable into present contents, which might, theoretically, be just what they are even if no past had existed.
3138|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000009_000002.wav|8230|This would SEEM to suggest that we have a way of knowing the past which is independent of images, by means of which we can criticize image memories.
3139|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000003_000009.wav|8230|The purely psychological problems which it raises are not very difficult, though they have sometimes been rendered artificially obscure by unwillingness to admit the fallibility of the non sensational elements of perception.
3140|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000028_000001.wav|8230|This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not.
3141|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000004_000004.wav|8230|And what sort of evidence is logically possible?
3142|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000008_000001.wav|8230|The behaviourist, who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour, has to trust his memory in making the record.
3143|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000003.wav|8230|In such a case we distrust our image in spite of its being unusually clear.
3144|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000019_000000.wav|8230|The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
3145|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000024_000006.wav|8230|They give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences, which is what constitutes knowledge memory.
3146|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000004.wav|8230|I think the characteristic by which we distinguish the images we trust is the feeling of FAMILIARITY that accompanies them.
3147|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000027_000001.wav|8230|This may be taken in two senses, the first when a thing not merely feels familiar, but we know it is such and such.
3148|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000022_000006.wav|8230|There is, for example, a habit of remembering a unique event.
3149|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000019_000003.wav|8230|How far our knowledge of the past is due to memory, and how far to other sources, is of course a matter to be investigated, but there can be no doubt that memory forms an indispensable part of our knowledge of the past.
3150|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000007_000000.wav|8230|I am not suggesting that the non existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.
3151|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000002.wav|8230|We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague, which yet we do not trust-for example, under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted.
3152|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000010_000000.wav|8230|What results, formally, from our knowledge of the past through images of which we recognize the inaccuracy, is that such images must have two characteristics by which we can arrange them in two series, of which one corresponds to the more or less remote period in the past to which they refer, and the other to our greater or less confidence in their accuracy.
3153|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000001.wav|8230|We have this feeling normally in places where we have often been before-at home, or in well-known streets.
3154|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000008.wav|8230|I think it is by this means that we become critical of images, not by some imageless memory with which we compare them.
3155|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000022_000009.wav|8230|A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its past; and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe.
3156|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000024_000007.wav|8230|It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge.
3157|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000015_000000.wav|8230|We may say, then, that images are regarded by us as more or less accurate copies of past occurrences because they come to us with two sorts of feelings: (one) Those that may be called feelings of familiarity; (two) those that may be collected together as feelings giving a sense of pastness.
3158|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000023_000002.wav|8230|It is this sort of occurrence that constitutes the essence of memory Until we have analysed what happens in such a case as this, we have not succeeded in understanding memory.
3159|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000024_000000.wav|8230|The sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort which is a form of knowledge.
3160|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000029_000004.wav|8230|Thus, if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it forms part of "my experience" by DEFINITION: recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world.
3161|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000003_000001.wav|8230|I shall discuss this question in later lectures.
3162|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000006_000001.wav|8230|In the first place, everything constituting a memory belief is happening now, not in that past time to which the belief is said to refer.
3163|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000022_000005.wav|8230|But it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory. Habit is a very intrusive feature of our mental life, and is often present where at first sight it seems not to be.
3164|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000014_000001.wav|8230|Very often our knowledge of the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present is inferred from its temporal relations to other remembered events.
3165|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000029_000001.wav|8230|To begin with, it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as "I have seen this before" than as "this has existed before." We recognize a thing (it may be urged) as having been in our experience before, whatever that may mean; we do not recognize it as merely having been in the world before.
3166|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000028_000003.wav|8230|It differs from the sense of familiarity by being cognitive; it is a belief or judgment, which the sense of familiarity is not.
3167|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000022_000000.wav|8230|It is important not to confuse the two forms of memory which Bergson distinguishes in the second chapter of his "Matter and Memory," namely the sort that consists of habit, and the sort that consists of independent recollection.
3168|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000027_000004.wav|8230|When we see a cat, we know it is a cat because of previous cats we have seen, but we do not, as a rule, recollect at the moment any particular occasion when we have seen a cat.
3169|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000001_000001.wav|8230|MEMORY
3170|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000024_000009.wav|8230|Before considering true memory, it will be well to consider two things which are on the way towards memory, namely the feeling of familiarity and recognition.
3171|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000014_000000.wav|8230|There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present, and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
3172|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000013_000003.wav|8230|One of these is context.
3173|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000014_000002.wav|8230|It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present, but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events.
3174|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000013_000001.wav|8230|There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of "pastness," especially where immediate memory is concerned.
3175|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000021_000000.wav|8230|A third point, perhaps not quite so certain as our previous two, is that the truth of memory cannot be wholly practical, as pragmatists wish all truth to be.
3176|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000029_000002.wav|8230|I am not sure that there is anything substantial in this point.
3177|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000023_000001.wav|8230|I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before, such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning, and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this.
3178|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000008_000000.wav|8230|In the second place, images without beliefs are insufficient to constitute memory; and habits are still more insufficient.
3179|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000004_000006.wav|8230|How, then, are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation?
3180|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000022_000001.wav|8230|He gives the instance of learning a lesson by heart: when I know it by heart I am said to "remember" it, but this merely means that I have acquired certain habits; on the other hand, my recollection of (say) the second time I read the lesson while I was learning it is the recollection of a unique event, which occurred only once.
3181|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000024_000002.wav|8230|The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.
3182|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000008_000004.wav|8230|If we are to know as it is supposed we do-that images are "copies," accurate or inaccurate, of past events, something more than the mere occurrence of images must go to constitute this knowledge.
3183|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000004.wav|8230|It is by no means always reliable; almost everybody has at some time experienced the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.
3184|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000012_000003.wav|8230|The question which of these occurs is not of any importance for the theoretic serviceability of the characteristic in question.
3185|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000006.wav|8230|Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees.
3186|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000028_000004.wav|8230|I do not wish to undertake the analysis of belief at present, since it will be the subject of the twelfth lecture; for the present I merely wish to emphasize the fact that recognition, in our second sense, consists in a belief, which we may express approximately in the words: "This has existed before."
3187|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000018_000004.wav|8230|In like manner, in the study of memory, the certainties with which you begin are very vague, and the more precise propositions at which you try to arrive are less certain than the hazy data from which you set out.
3188|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000019_000002.wav|8230|Nevertheless, whatever a sceptic might urge in theory, we cannot practically doubt that we got up this morning, that we did various things yesterday, that a great war has been taking place, and so on.
3189|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000003.wav|8230|The feeling of familiarity has all sorts of degrees, down to the stage where we dimly feel that we have seen a person before.
3190|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000002.wav|8230|Most people and animals find it essential to their happiness to spend a good deal of their time in familiar surroundings, which are especially comforting when any danger threatens.
3191|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000029_000005.wav|8230|Of course, the words "this has existed before" are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition, but that is unavoidable: words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive, and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition.
3192|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000007.wav|8230|In an image of a well-known face, for example, some parts may feel more familiar than others; when this happens, we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts.
3193|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000006_000002.wav|8230|It is not logically necessary to the existence of a memory belief that the event remembered should have occurred, or even that the past should have existed at all.
3194|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000013_000004.wav|8230|A recent memory has, usually, more context than a more distant one.
3195|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000013_000002.wav|8230|But apart from this, there are other marks.
3196|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000008_000005.wav|8230|For their mere occurrence, by itself, would not suggest any connection with anything that had happened before.
3197|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000018_000000.wav|8230|Some points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
3198|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000003_000006.wav|8230|The FACT of past experience is essential in producing this filling out of sensation, but not the RECOLLECTION of past experience.
3199|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000003_000003.wav|8230|Sensation, we decided, is not a form of knowledge.
3200|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000027_000003.wav|8230|Here we have a definite influence of past experience, but not necessarily any actual knowledge of the past.
3201|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000005.wav|8230|Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange.
3202|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000017_000003.wav|8230|Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling, or related to, what is remembered.
3203|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000004_000002.wav|8230|Such modifications of Hume's principle, however, do not affect the problem which I wish to present for your consideration, namely: Why do we believe that images are, sometimes or always, approximately or exactly, copies of sensations?
3204|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000021_000002.wav|8230|The definition of truth as the correspondence between beliefs and facts seems peculiarly evident in the case of memory, as against not only the pragmatist definition but also the idealist definition by means of coherence.
3205|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000024_000003.wav|8230|Similarly, the performances of animals in getting out of cages or mazes to which they are accustomed do not prove that they remember having been in the same situation before. Arguments in favour of (for example) memory in plants are only arguments in favour of habit memory, not of knowledge memory.
3206|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000008.wav|8230|The judgment that what is familiar has been experienced before is a product of reflection, and is no part of the feeling of familiarity, such as a horse may be supposed to have when he returns to his stable.
3207|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000009_000001.wav|8230|How is it possible to know that a memory image is an imperfect copy, without having a more accurate copy by which to replace it?
3208|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000009.wav|8230|Thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
3209|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000011_000001.wav|8230|It might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic, but I do not think this is the case.
3210|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000017_000002.wav|8230|But the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary.
3211|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000008_000003.wav|8230|And the same applies to images.
3212|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000026_000005.wav|8230|There are occasions when familiarity does not attach itself to any definite object, when there is merely a vague feeling that SOMETHING is familiar.
3213|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000010_000001.wav|8230|We will take the second of these points first.
3214|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000003_000004.wav|8230|It might, however, have been expected that we should begin our discussion of knowledge with PERCEPTION, i e with that integral experience of things in the environment, out of which sensation is extracted by psychological analysis.
3215|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000022_000007.wav|8230|When we have once described the event, the words we have used easily become habitual.
3216|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000004_000003.wav|8230|What sort of evidence is there?
3217|test-clean/8230/279154/8230_279154_000027_000005.wav|8230|Recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association: the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word "cat," or with an auditory image of purring, or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.

3893|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000023_000000.wav|7176|The last drop fly, as luck would have it, caught just in the corner of the hawk's angrily open beak, hooking itself firmly.
3894|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000004_000001.wav|7176|It was not in the quiet pools and long, deep reaches of dark water that he loved to seek his prey, but rather to snatch it from the grasp of the loud chutes and the roaring rips.
3895|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000011_000001.wav|7176|But the hawk was already close upon him.
3896|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000024_000000.wav|7176|The drake, unrealizing that the dreadful chase was done, sped onward beneath the surface till he could go without breath no longer.
3897|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000006_000003.wav|7176|But here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls, hawks, and eagles.
3898|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000018_000000.wav|7176|A few yards further on, the torrent fell seething over a long ledge into a pool of brief quiet.
3899|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000005_000004.wav|7176|His feet were red, his long narrow beak, with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip, was bright red.
3900|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000016_000000.wav|7176|The drake sank again instantly.
3901|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000017_000000.wav|7176|Immediately over his outstretched gleaming head flew the hawk.
3902|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000007_000000.wav|7176|But suddenly, straight and swift as a diving cormorant, he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface.
3903|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000006_000004.wav|7176|He had no rending claws.
3904|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000012_000005.wav|7176|The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
3905|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000005_000005.wav|7176|In every line and hue he was unmistakably an aristocrat among ducks, and an arrogant one at that.
3906|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000014_000001.wav|7176|Like his unfortunate little cousin, the teal, he, too, had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart, and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank, deep fringed with weeds, where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him.
3907|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000019_000001.wav|7176|The hawk, embittered by the loss of his first quarry, had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel, not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived.
3908|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000016_000005.wav|7176|It was a mongrel method of progression, in which he was singularly expert.
3909|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000023_000008.wav|7176|The fisherman reeled in the limp coils, and the worried hawk flew off with the flies.
3910|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000005_000003.wav|7176|The merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black, a broad collar of lustrous white, black back, black and white wings, white belly, sides finely pencilled in black and white, and a breast of rich chestnut red, streaked with black.
3911|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000013_000002.wav|7176|Happily for him, he on his part caught sight of the hawk, and dropped like lead into the torrent.
3912|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000013_000000.wav|7176|The spot where all this happened was perhaps a hundred yards below that dead tree upon whose outthrust naked branch the splendid merganser drake was making his meal.
3913|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000017_000005.wav|7176|Where the waves for an instant sank, they came closer,--but not quite within grasping reach.
3914|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000015_000002.wav|7176|Almost instantly he was forced to the top.
3915|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000013_000003.wav|7176|The hawk alighted on the dead branch, and sat upright, motionless, as if surprised.
3916|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000024_000004.wav|7176|There was no such thing as a hawk in sight.
3917|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000024_000001.wav|7176|Then he came up among some arrowweeds, lifted his head beneath the shelter of one of the broad barbed leaves, and floated there quivering.
3918|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000016_000003.wav|7176|He would have been drowned, the breath battered clean out of him, in half a minute more, had he maintained the hopelessly unequal struggle.
3919|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000023_000006.wav|7176|For a moment the fisherman, bewildered, tried to play him like a salmon.
3920|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000013_000001.wav|7176|In fact, he had just finished it-the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet-when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped.
3921|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000018_000003.wav|7176|The wily drake had plunged with the plunge of the fall itself, and was now darting onward at a safe depth.
3922|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000005_000000.wav|7176|For all the splendor of his plumage, the merganser was not conspicuous where he sat
3923|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000018_000005.wav|7176|The pool was, perhaps, a hundred yards in length.
3924|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000008_000002.wav|7176|Here he proceeded to swallow his prize head first.
3925|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000012_000000.wav|7176|As it chanced, however, the victim came down with a thud almost beneath the whiskered nose of the wildcat.
3926|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000010_000000.wav|7176|The teal's wings, throbbing with a swift, short vibration, whistled shrilly in the still air, so that a prowling wildcat by the waterside heard the sound even above the dull roar of the rapids, and glared upward alertly.
3927|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000022_000002.wav|7176|He saw the great hawk swoop savagely.
3928|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000024_000007.wav|7176|He rose noisily into the air, made a detour over the tree tops to avoid the fisherman, and flew back to his dead branch overhanging the amber rush of the chutes.
3929|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000022_000001.wav|7176|He saw the frantic fugitive dive over the ledge and disappear.
3930|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000011_000005.wav|7176|It was enough, however, and the unhappy teal was hurled earthward, flapping through the tips of the branches.
3931|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000018_000004.wav|7176|The hawk followed, his wing tips now almost brushing the water.
3932|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000003_000000.wav|7176|In fact, after the fashion of a cormorant or a kingfisher, he was perched motionless on a big dead stub of a branch.
3933|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000018_000001.wav|7176|Immediately beyond the lip of the ledge the hawk lifted his wings high over his back and struck downward, so that his talons went deep into the water.
3934|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000003_000001.wav|7176|This branch was thrust out very obligingly in just the place where this most singular of ducks would have desired it if it had been consulted in the matter.
3935|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000018_000007.wav|7176|But, as before, the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer, and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam, while doom hung low above his head, yet hesitated to strike.
3936|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000015_000004.wav|7176|Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.
3937|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000016_000004.wav|7176|Once more he half emerged, filled his gasping lungs, and pounded onward desperately, half flying and half swimming.
3938|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000004_000003.wav|7176|And most of the fish-trout, salmon, grilse or parr-which journeyed up and down either the Fork or the parent river chose to pass through that sluice of swift but unbroken flow immediately beneath the overhanging branch on which he perched.
3939|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000006_000005.wav|7176|Had he taken such a prize, he could not have profited by it, having no means of tearing it to pieces.
3940|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000006_000002.wav|7176|His beak, with its keen toothed edges, was a formidable weapon, by means of which he could doubtless have captured, disabled, and dragged to shore even a fish of a pound or so in weight.
3941|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000002_000003.wav|7176|He was too imposing in appearance, too gorgeous in apparel, too bold and vigilant in demeanor to be so misunderstood.
3942|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000015_000000.wav|7176|The hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface.
3943|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000002_000004.wav|7176|Moreover, he was not in the situation or the surroundings which one is wont to associate with ducks.
3944|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000020_000001.wav|7176|He had three flies on his cast, and, because in these waters there was always the chance of hooking a grilse, he was using heavy tackle.
3945|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000012_000003.wav|7176|But wisdom came to him just in time, and he did not strike home.
3946|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000012_000004.wav|7176|His swoop became a demonstration merely, an expression of his rage at having his prey thus snatched from his beak. With one short, shrill cry of anger, he swerved off and sailed upward over the river.
3947|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000005_000002.wav|7176|The rapids were foam white, or golden ruddy, or deep, shining green brown under the sharp and patchy sunlight, and they were sown thickly with wet black rocks, here and there glinting with purple.
3948|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000022_000000.wav|7176|Just as he made his cast, he saw the fleeing drake and the pursuing hawk come round the bend.
3949|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000023_000004.wav|7176|The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him, and appalling.
3950|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000024_000002.wav|7176|For a good ten minutes he waited, moveless, with the patience of the wild things. Then his terror faded, appetite once more began to invite his attention, and he took note of a minnow flickering slowly over the sun flecked mud below him.
3951|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000007_000001.wav|7176|A watcher directly overhead, escaping the baffling reflections, might have seen him swimming, head outstretched, mastering the tremendous rush of the stream with mighty strokes, fairly out speeding the fish in their own element. Near the limit of the clear water he overtook and seized the quarry which he had marked-a trout not far from seven inches in length.
3952|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000024_000003.wav|7176|He dived and caught it, came to the surface and swallowed it. Much refreshed, he looked about him.
3953|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000011_000006.wav|7176|The great hawk followed hurriedly, to retrieve his prey from the ground.
3954|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000019_000000.wav|7176|The odds, however, were now laid heavily against the fugitive.
3955|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000017_000006.wav|7176|The marauder from the upper air was waiting till his quarry should reach less turbulent waters.
3956|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000014_000000.wav|7176|The fisher of the chutes, meanwhile, was swimming straight downstream for the broken water.
3957|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000003_000002.wav|7176|It directly overhung a transparent amber brown chute of unbroken water in the midst of the loud turmoil of North Fork Rapids.
3958|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000020_000002.wav|7176|His flies, as befitted these amber brown, tumultuous northern streams, were large and conspicuous-a Parmacheenie Belle for the tail fly, with a Montreal and a Red Hackle for the drops.
3959|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000004_000000.wav|7176|The duck was a handsome male of the red breasted merganser family, and the absorbing interest of his life was fish.
3960|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000019_000003.wav|7176|Then, in the still water, unless he should chance upon a hiding place, the drake would soon be forced to come to the top for breath, and those throttling talons would instantly close upon his neck.
3961|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000023_000007.wav|7176|Then the leader parted from the line.
3962|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000023_000001.wav|7176|At the sudden sharp sting of it, the great bird turned his head and noticed, for the first time, the fisherman standing on the bank.
3963|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000002_000000.wav|7176|He was plainly a duck.
3964|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000012_000001.wav|7176|A pounce, and the great cat had her paw upon it, and crouched snarling up at the hawk.
3965|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000011_000002.wav|7176|In despair he hurled himself downward too soon.
3966|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000023_000002.wav|7176|At the same moment he felt the light restraint of the almost invisible leader upon his wings, where the other two flies had affixed themselves.
3967|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000009_000002.wav|7176|But behind him, overtaking him inexorably, came the shape that stood for doom itself in the eyes of all his tribe-the dreadful blue falcon, or duck hawk.
3968|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000001_000000.wav|7176|The Fisher in the Chutes
3969|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000004_000002.wav|7176|Here, where the North Fork stream fell into the Ottanoonsis, was a resort exactly to his liking.
3970|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000019_000004.wav|7176|But the antic forest Fates, wearied of the simple routine of the wilderness, had decreed an altogether novel intervention, and were giggling in their cloaks of ancient moss.
3971|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000018_000002.wav|7176|But water was all they clutched.
3972|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000011_000000.wav|7176|Close ahead of him now the teal saw refuge-the flashing line of the rapids.
3973|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000009_000000.wav|7176|Just about this time, in the clear blue overhead, a green winged teal was beating his way above the treetops, making for the stream with the fear of death at his heart.
3974|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000010_000002.wav|7176|For all its appalling speed, the sound of his flight was nothing more than a strong pulsating hiss.
3975|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000022_000003.wav|7176|He tried to check his cast, but it was too late.
3976|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000019_000002.wav|7176|The rapids would presently come to an end.
3977|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000015_000003.wav|7176|With only head and wings above the mad smother, he flapped onward frantically, beating down the foam about him.
3978|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000016_000002.wav|7176|As long as his body was completely submerged, it was at the mercy of the twisting and tortured currents, which rolled him over and over, in spite of his swimming craft.
3979|test-clean/7176/88083/7176_88083_000024_000006.wav|7176|The drake was suspicious of men, though he did not greatly fear them, as he and his rank fleshed tribe were not interesting to the hunters.

3986|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000012_000000.wav|7176|These few remarks are called a soliloquy, being addressed rather to the world in general than to any particular person on the stage.
3987|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000094_000000.wav|7176|It makes a different thing of it altogether.

3989|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000056_000002.wav|7176|Then the curtain rises, and it is apparent that we are assisting at an At Home of considerable splendour.

3995|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000083_000000.wav|7176|Tea is the most usual meal on the stage, for the reason that it is the least expensive, the property lump of sugar being dusted and used again on the next night.

3997|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000018_000000.wav|7176|And so on, till you get to the end, when Ophelia might say, "Ah, yes," or something non committal of that sort.
3998|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000081_000001.wav|7176|Good bye; so glad you could come.

4000|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000018_000001.wav|7176|This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.
4001|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000085_000000.wav|7176|Now although it is possible, in the case of a few men at the top of the profession, to leave the conduct of the cigarette entirely to the actor, you will find it much more satisfactory to insert in the stage directions the particular movements (with match and so forth) that you wish carried out.

4005|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000018_000002.wav|7176|What you want is to make it clear that you are conveying Hamlet's thoughts to the audience in rather a clever manner.
4006|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000084_000001.wav|7176|Without the stage cigarette many an epigram would pass unnoticed, many an actor's hands would be much more noticeable; and the man who works the fireproof safety curtain would lose even the small amount of excitement which at present attaches to his job.

4010|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000006_000000.wav|7176|Frankly I cannot always say.
4011|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000020_000000.wav|7176|Let us, to give an example of how this method works, go back again to the play we have been discussing.

4014|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000022_000021.wav|7176|Yes, that's right.
4015|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000070_000003.wav|7176|This is how it should go:--
4016|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000069_000001.wav|7176|Then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage.
4017|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000013_000000.wav|7176|So the soliloquy came into being.

4019|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000085_000004.wav|7176|Now this answer, even if it comes quite fresh to the stalls, will lose much of its effect if it is said without the assistance of a cigarette.
4020|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000028_000000.wav|7176|And so on.

4022|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000012_000003.wav|7176|Of course, a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression.

4030|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000031_000004.wav|7176|The obvious answer, that the firm which is mentioned in the programme as supplying his trousers would be annoyed if he didn't, is not enough; nor is it enough to say that the whole plot of the piece hinges on him, and that without him the drama would languish.
4031|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000031_000006.wav|7176|Was it only a coincidence?

4034|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000058_000003.wav|7176|Do play it again.
4035|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000019_000003.wav|7176|Could anything be more natural?

4043|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000069_000002.wav|7176|A stage meal is popular, because it proves to the audience that the actors, even when called Charles Hawtrey or Owen Nares, are real people just like you and me.
4044|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000083_000005.wav|7176|Besides, the thing is coming back again as chicken directly.
4045|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000089_000001.wav|7176|Once more:---
4046|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000055_000000.wav|7176|The answer to this will depend upon the length of the play, for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises.
4047|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000015_000001.wav|7176|Stagecraft is the art of getting over these and other difficulties, and (if possible) getting over them in a showy manner, so that people will say, "How remarkable his stagecraft is for so young a writer," when otherwise they mightn't have noticed it at all.
4048|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000035_000001.wav|7176|You will see this for yourself if you consider the passage as it should properly have been written:--

4050|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000028_000001.wav|7176|Which strikes me as rather sweet and natural.

4054|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000084_000000.wav|7176|But it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection.
4055|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000040_000001.wav|7176|What is it?
4056|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000004_000002.wav|7176|It was an unsatisfying life; and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did, he used to say that he was for the Bar.
4057|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000053_000001.wav|7176|You will, of course, appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time, but also make the manoeuvring very much more natural.
4058|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000032_000001.wav|7176|If that be so, he must explain it.

4060|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000023_000001.wav|7176|You see how effective it is.
4061|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000085_000002.wav|7176|Let us assume further that you wish Lord john to reply, "A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."
4062|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000012_000001.wav|7176|Now the object of this soliloquy is plain.
4063|test-clean/7176/92135/7176_92135_000085_000001.wav|7176|Let us assume that Lord Arthur asks Lord john what a cynic is-the question of what a cynic is having arisen quite naturally in the course of the plot.

4067|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000015_000001.wav|7021|In the palace yard stood two soldiers with shining helmets, and with muskets over their shoulders; and when Anders came, both the muskets were levelled at him.
4068|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000022_000000.wav|7021|At the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows.

4071|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000033_000000.wav|7021|"But surely you would like to change caps with me," said the King, and raised his large, heavy gold crown from his head.
4072|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000022_000001.wav|7021|On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
4073|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000017_000000.wav|7021|"I am going to the court ball," answered Anders.
4074|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000029_000000.wav|7021|Then the doors were thrown open, and the King entered with a large suite of gentlemen in glittering uniforms and plumed hats.
4075|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000008_000000.wav|7021|At the turn of the road he ran up against the tanner's boy, Lars.

4077|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000004_000001.wav|7021|But Anders cared nothing about that.
4078|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000040_000000.wav|7021|But his mother hugged him close.

4082|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000032_000000.wav|7021|"So it is," said Anders.
4083|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000013_000001.wav|7021|She called him a little gentleman and said that he was so fine that he might go to the royal court ball.

4086|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000035_000004.wav|7021|But he had his cap. He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
4087|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000035_000000.wav|7021|With one jump Anders got out of his chair.
4088|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000025_000000.wav|7021|"Well, well, give it to me," said the Princess, "and I will give you a kiss."
4089|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000042_000001.wav|7021|He knew well enough that mother's cap was the best cap in all the world.
4090|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000002_000000.wav|7021|Once upon a time there was a little boy, called Anders, who had a new cap.

4092|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000005_000000.wav|7021|The first person he met was a farm labourer walking alongside a load of peat and smacking at his horse.
4093|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000021_000001.wav|7021|For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.

4095|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000034_000001.wav|7021|He sat as before, and held on to his red cap which everybody was so anxious to get.
4096|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000036_000000.wav|7021|And his mother took him up in her lap, and he told her all his adventures, and how everybody wanted his cap.
4097|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000037_000000.wav|7021|But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
4098|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000026_000001.wav|7021|He only shook his head.

4103|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000002_000001.wav|7021|And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.
4104|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000022_000002.wav|7021|The Princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses; and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by her side.
4105|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000019_000001.wav|7021|When she became aware of Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.
4106|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000016_000000.wav|7021|"Where may you be going?" asked one of the soldiers.
4107|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000035_000003.wav|7021|He ran so fast that the Princess's necklace fell off his neck, and all the cakes jumped out of his pockets.
4108|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000041_000001.wav|7021|"If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap."
4109|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000035_000001.wav|7021|He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
4110|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000010_000000.wav|7021|Now this knife was a splendid one, though half the blade was gone, and the handle was a little cracked; and Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife.
4111|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000006_000000.wav|7021|"Dear me," he said, "if I did not think it was the gracious little count himself." And then he invited Anders to ride on the peat load.
4112|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000014_000000.wav|7021|"Yes, why not?" thought Anders.
4113|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000015_000000.wav|7021|And so he did.
4114|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000042_000000.wav|7021|Then Anders felt brave again.
4115|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000004_000002.wav|7021|He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
4116|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000035_000002.wav|7021|He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
4117|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000008_000001.wav|7021|He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife. He gazed and gazed at the cap, and could not keep from fingering the blue tassel.
4118|test-clean/7021/85628/7021_85628_000034_000000.wav|7021|Anders did not answer.

4129|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000044_000003.wav|7021|The object of this work is, accordingly, not to show how the gentle methods which will be brought to view can be employed as a substitute for such authority, but how they can be made to aid in establishing and maintaining it.
4130|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000043_000000.wav|7021|THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT.
4131|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000065_000003.wav|7021|A child, even, who has become once accustomed to them, will soon drop them if she finds, owing to a change in the system of management, that they now never succeed.
4132|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000051_000001.wav|7021|Many mothers manage their children by means of tricks and contrivances, more or less adroit, designed to avoid direct issues with them, and to beguile them, as it were, into compliance with their wishes.
4133|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000059_000001.wav|7021|By the third method the mother secures the compliance of the child by a direct exercise of authority.
4134|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000051_000003.wav|7021|She brings down her bonnet and shawl by stealth, and before the chaise comes to the door she sends Mary out into the garden with her sister, under pretense of showing her a bird's nest which is not there, trusting to her sister's skill in diverting the child's mind, and amusing her with something else in the garden, until the chaise has gone.
4135|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000061_000000.wav|7021|"Why can't you take me?" asks Mary.
4136|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000065_000004.wav|7021|And a child who never, from the beginning, finds any efficiency in them, never learns to employ them at all.
4137|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000048_000001.wav|7021|By Reason and Affection.
4138|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000046_000000.wav|7021|There are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements.
4139|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000065_000002.wav|7021|Those children only attempt to carry their points by noisy and violent demonstrations who find, by experience, that such measures are usually successful.
4140|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000056_000000.wav|7021|"Mary, your father and I are going out to ride this afternoon, and I am going to explain it all to you why you can not go too.

4142|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000044_000001.wav|7021|To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that, is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
4143|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000057_000000.wav|7021|The mother, in managing the case in this way, relies partly on convincing the reason of the child, and partly on an appeal to her affection.
4144|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000052_000000.wav|7021|As the chaise drives away, Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step, her mind in a tumult of excitement, in which hatred of the doctor, distrust and suspicion of her mother, disappointment, vexation, and ill humor, surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend-doing perhaps an irreparable injury.
4145|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000049_000001.wav|7021|By Authority.
4146|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000046_000001.wav|7021|They are,
4147|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000056_000002.wav|7021|You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly-won't you?
4148|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000055_000001.wav|7021|The theory of many mothers is that they must govern their children by the influence of reason and affection.
4149|test-clean/7021/79730/7021_79730_000067_000001.wav|7021|But the influences secured by these means form, at the best, but a sandy foundation for filial obedience to rest upon.
4150|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000004_000004.wav|7021|You have made a life-long change, if not in the very structure, at least in the permanent furnishing of her mind, and performed a work that can never by any possibility be undone.
4151|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000006_000003.wav|7021|Every story, therefore, which you relate to a child to exemplify the principles of justice or goodness takes its place, or, rather, the impression which it makes takes its place, as one of the elements out of which the ideas that are to govern his future life are formed.
4152|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000009_000003.wav|7021|Every strong impression which you make upon his perceptive powers must have a very lasting influence, and even the impression itself may, in some cases, be forever indelible.
4153|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000001_000000.wav|7021|CONCLUSION.
4154|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000006_000001.wav|7021|They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
4155|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000008_000000.wav|7021|For the ideas and generalizations thus mainly formed from the images and impressions received in childhood become, in later years, the elements of the machinery, so to speak, by which all his mental operations are performed.
4156|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000008_000001.wav|7021|Thus they seem to constitute more than the mere furniture of the mind; they form, as it were, almost a part of the structure itself.
4157|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000010_000002.wav|7021|We can not surrender this trust.
4158|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000004_000005.wav|7021|The images which have been awakened in her mind, the emotions connected with them, and the effect of these images and emotions upon her faculties of imagination and conception, will infuse a life into them which will make her, in respect to this aspect of her spiritual nature, a different being as long as she lives.
4159|test-clean/7021/79759/7021_79759_000009_000001.wav|7021|The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
4160|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000015_000002.wav|7021|Nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution, and the medicine was ready.
4161|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000019_000000.wav|7021|So saying, she led the way on tiptoe, followed by the children out of the room, and round by a circuitous route to the piazza.
4162|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000013_000000.wav|7021|"Ah!" said Della in a tone of great concern, and looking again at Andella, "I heard that you had been sick.
4163|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000021_000001.wav|7021|And this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been.
4164|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000022_000001.wav|7021|If you can lead children to cure themselves of their faults in such a way that they shall have a good time in doing it, there is a double gain.
4165|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000010_000006.wav|7021|I observe that, when you both wish for the same thing, you don't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another; but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it.
4166|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000021_000000.wav|7021|So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
4167|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000007_000000.wav|7021|Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
4168|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000017_000000.wav|7021|Delia was accustomed to use the dolls not only for the purpose of instruction, but sometimes for reproof, in many ingenious ways.
4169|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000003_000002.wav|7021|Such persons may be interested in the manner in which Delia made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers.
4170|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000020_000002.wav|7021|I would not have them know that their mothers leave their playthings about in that way for any consideration.
4171|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000010_000002.wav|7021|How nice you look!
4172|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000011_000000.wav|7021|Then, turning to Jane, she asked, in a somewhat altered tone, "Has she been a good girl, Jane?"
4173|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000002_000000.wav|7021|DELLA AND THE DOLLS.
4174|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000005_000001.wav|7021|Besides dressing and undressing them, and playing take them out to excursions and visits, they used to talk with them a great deal, and give them much useful and valuable information and instruction.
4175|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000010_000005.wav|7021|You will have a very pleasant time, I am sure; because you never quarrel.
4176|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000020_000001.wav|7021|Put them away quick before Andella and Rosalie see them.
4177|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000020_000000.wav|7021|"There!" said she, pointing to the playthings; "see! all your playthings left out!
4178|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000020_000005.wav|7021|Put these playthings all away quick, and carefully, and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out."
4179|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000010_000004.wav|7021|I am very glad.
4180|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000013_000002.wav|7021|And you don't look very well now.
4181|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000003_000001.wav|7021|To such persons, these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will, or rather of yielding to their influence, are specially useful.
4182|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000009_000001.wav|7021|If Delia had attempted to give precisely the same lecture to the children themselves, they would very soon have become restless and uneasy, and it would have made very little impression upon them.
4183|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000009_000002.wav|7021|But being addressed to the dolls, they would be greatly interested in it, and would listen with the utmost attention; and there is no doubt that the counsels and instructions which she gave made a much stronger impression upon their minds than if they had been addressed directly to the children themselves. To give an idea of these conversations I will report one of them in full.
4184|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000017_000001.wav|7021|For instance, one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings, and finally had gone into the house, leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza, instead of putting them away in their places, as they ought to have done.
4185|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000020_000003.wav|7021|They would think that they might do so too, and that would make you a great deal of trouble.
4186|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000017_000002.wav|7021|They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
4187|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000022_000000.wav|7021|Besides, a scolding would have made them unhappy, and this did not make them unhappy at all; it amused and entertained them.
4188|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000018_000001.wav|7021|I want you to come with me.
4189|test-clean/7021/79740/7021_79740_000010_000000.wav|7021|"How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.

4318|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000027_000002.wav|260|I return to the Icelander.
4319|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000013_000000.wav|260|I then remembered that the Professor, before starting, had estimated the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues.

4324|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000049_000000.wav|260|At three hundred yards from us the battle was fought.
4325|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000025_000000.wav|260|I looked at the hunter.
4326|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000060_000004.wav|260|Suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water.

4330|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000036_000001.wav|260|The danger is approaching.
4331|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000033_000000.wav|260|I saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length.

4334|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000047_000001.wav|260|The reptiles rose; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.

4336|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000060_000001.wav|260|The struggle continues with unabated ferocity.

4338|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000007.wav|260|The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves.
4339|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000020_000000.wav|260|I take this as my answer, and I leave the Professor to bite his lips with impatience.
4340|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000028_000000.wav|260|"Teeth!" I cried, considering the iron bar with more attention.
4341|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000005_000000.wav|260|My uncle has had no dreams, but he is out of temper.
4342|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000061_000000.wav|260|All at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the plesiosaurus.
4343|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000044_000001.wav|260|"I can see its great fins.

4345|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000040_000000.wav|260|Hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away, rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges.
4346|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000043_000002.wav|260|It is diving down!"
4347|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000014_000000.wav|260|"We are not descending as we ought to be," the Professor declares. "We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft."
4348|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000027_000001.wav|260|I had rather not disturb him while he is quiet.
4349|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000032_000001.wav|260|No human eye has ever beheld them living.
4350|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000045_000002.wav|260|They were of supernatural dimensions; the smallest of them would have crunched our raft, crew and all, at one snap of its huge jaws.
4351|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000006_000004.wav|260|Is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed?
4352|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000038_000001.wav|260|The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of twenty fathoms.
4353|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000048_000000.wav|260|We stood dumb with fear.
4354|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000029_000002.wav|260|I could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar.
4355|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000057_000001.wav|260|Two monsters only were creating all this commotion; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world.
4356|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000045_000001.wav|260|We stood amazed, thunderstruck, at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters.
4357|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000043_000001.wav|260|Look at its vast jaws and its rows of teeth!
4358|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000009_000000.wav|260|"Impatient, then?"
4359|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000035_000000.wav|260|I look at our guns and see that they are all right.
4360|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000061_000002.wav|260|I no longer see his scaly armour.
4361|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000023_000000.wav|260|My uncle took soundings several times.
4362|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000037_000002.wav|260|Hans was at the helm.
4363|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000048_000003.wav|260|I prepare to fire.
4364|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000060_000005.wav|260|Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under water.
4365|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000019_000002.wav|260|Therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects."
4366|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000035_000001.wav|260|My uncle notices it, and looks on approvingly.
4367|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000039_000001.wav|260|"Have we struck land?"
4368|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000033_000003.wav|260|Yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.
4369|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000019_000001.wav|260|I came with an object, and I mean to attain it.
4370|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000002.wav|260|Weather unchanged.
4371|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000055_000000.wav|260|"And the other?"
4372|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000060_000003.wav|260|We remain motionless, ready to fire.
4373|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000005_000001.wav|260|He examines the horizon all round with his glass, and folds his arms with the air of an injured man.
4374|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000047_000000.wav|260|Flight was out of the question now.
4375|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000012_000001.wav|260|I am not complaining that the rate is slow, but that the sea is so wide."
4376|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000006_000002.wav|260|And yet, what cause was there for anger?
4377|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000003_000002.wav|260|The horizon seems extremely distant.
4378|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000019_000000.wav|260|"But I don't care for prospects.
4379|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000003.wav|260|The wind freshens.
4380|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000059_000002.wav|260|The two beasts are fast locked together; I cannot distinguish the one from the other.

4382|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000054_000000.wav|260|"No: the first of those monsters has a porpoise's snout, a lizard's head, a crocodile's teeth; and hence our mistake.
4383|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000047_000003.wav|260|I took up my rifle.
4384|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000012_000000.wav|260|"What does that signify?
4385|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000011_000000.wav|260|"Yet we are going very fast."
4386|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000057_000002.wav|260|I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal, and as large as a man's head.
4387|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000031_000001.wav|260|The world then belonged to reptiles.
4388|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000049_000005.wav|260|He shakes his head negatively.
4389|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000053_000000.wav|260|"Surely you must be mistaken," I cried.
4390|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000034_000003.wav|260|What a very bad notion that was of his, I thought to myself, to take soundings just here!
4391|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000024_000000.wav|260|But when the pick was shipped again, Hans pointed out on its surface deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard bodies.
4392|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000038_000000.wav|260|Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me.
4393|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000034_000002.wav|260|I suppose Professor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my fears, for after having examined the pick, his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side.
4394|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000061_000003.wav|260|Only his long neck shoots up, drops again, coils and uncoils, droops, lashes the waters like a gigantic whip, and writhes like a worm that you tread on.
4395|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000004.wav|260|On awaking, my first thought was to observe the intensity of the light.
4396|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000048_000002.wav|260|The remainder of the sea monsters have disappeared.
4397|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000049_000002.wav|260|But it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the fray-the porpoise, the whale, the lizard, the tortoise.
4398|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000061_000006.wav|260|But soon the reptile's agony draws to an end; its movements become fainter, its contortions cease to be so violent, and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on the labouring deep.
4399|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000004_000000.wav|260|My head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.
4400|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000022_000001.wav|260|It must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic-and why not?
4401|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000021_000005.wav|260|I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim, or fail altogether.

4404|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000061_000004.wav|260|The water is splashed for a long way around.
4405|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000042_000000.wav|260|"Yes," replied my uncle, "and there is a sea lizard of vast size."
4406|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000007_000000.wav|260|"-You seem anxious, my uncle," I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye.
4407|test-clean/260/123286/260_123286_000040_000001.wav|260|I looked and cried:

4568|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000035_000001.wav|8555|Then she seated herself in an out of the way place and quietly waited.
4569|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000008_000001.wav|8555|But you were mistaken.
4570|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000005_000002.wav|8555|While he put on his clothes the king occasionally gave the cord a sudden pull, hoping to hurt Cap'n Bill's big toe and make him yell; but as no response came to this mean action the Boolooroo finally looked into the room, only to find he had been pulling on a leg of the couch and that his prisoner had escaped.
4571|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000034_000000.wav|8555|So the Captain took a file of soldiers and went away very sorrowful, for he did not know who would be the victim, and if the Boolooroo had no friends, the Captain had plenty, and did not wish to see them patched.

4577|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000012_000000.wav|8555|Trot was in the room, too, standing in a corner and listening to all that was said while she racked her little brain for an idea that would enable her to save Cap'n Bill from being patched.
4578|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000014_000000.wav|8555|As soon as they entered the Room of the Great Knife the Boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment.
4579|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000045_000001.wav|8555|Then she stood back and watched the Boolooroo, and just as he pulled the cord she pulled on her rope and dragged the frame on its rollers away, so that the Great Knife fell with a crash and sliced nothing but the air.

4582|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000050_000002.wav|8555|Before any could stop him he butted his Majesty so furiously that the King soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches, where he lay moaning and groaning.
4583|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000013_000000.wav|8555|After breakfast was over a procession was formed, headed by the Boolooroo, and they marched the prisoner through the palace until they came to the Room of the Great Knife.

4585|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000065_000001.wav|8555|So Cap'n Bill held the Boolooroo, and the girl tied him fast in position, as Cap'n Bill had been tied, so that his Majesty couldn't wiggle at all.

4587|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000008_000002.wav|8555|No one can resist the Mighty Boolooroo of the Blues, so it is folly for you to rebel against my commands.
4588|test-clean/8555/284447/8555_284447_000016_000000.wav|8555|The frightened soldiers hurried away to find Tiggle, and Trot was well pleased because she knew Tiggle was by this time safely hidden.

This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: "It's beyond everything.

4783|test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000016_000000.wav|121|He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant.

4792|test-clean/121/127105/121_127105_000016_000009.wav|121|To this his answer was prompt.
